At the time, which was late 1998, the concept of mobile email was foreign to all. Businesses used email but their primary way of receiving and responding to email was via a PC or laptop. Consumers also were into email thanks to AOL’s and Compuserve’s dial up programs but they too mostly used desktops or laptops to do their email.</p>
<p>We almost forget the role of the pager back then but this was the best we could get in mobile devices, which primarily sent a phone number to the pager to tell the person to call back ASAP.   Mostly used in medical, military and emergency services initially, by the mid 1990’s they were cheap enough for most business professionals to use and even some consumers who had need to be available at a moments notice.</p>
<p>By this time I lived and died by email. It became my main link between my clients and myself and was a major vehicle for how I got my work done. No longer a slave to the phone, my early Blackberry pager gave me my email anywhere I happened to be and allowed me to respond in real time. Like many Blackberry users in the late 1990’s, my Blackberry changed my business life and had a real impact on my family life too.</p>
<p>Over the next 10 years RIM created a powerful and secure email platform that was adopted in droves by businesses, government, military etc. Although they evolved the BlackBerry form factor significantly, they paid little attention to enhancing their OS exponentially in order to keep up with the major trend of smartphones and smart operating systems that came on the scene in early 2007. At first, RIM did not feel threatened by Apple’s original iPhone and even when it started getting some minor attention in business, the company was still clinging to its old OS and business model believing that their entrenched position in business, military and government was unshakeable. </p>
<p>But as history records, RIM did misjudge the impact of the iPhone on the entire smartphone market and to their chagrin, began unseating them in hundreds of business, military and government accounts, causing their fortunes to wane considerably. Up until the announcement of the new BB 10 OS last Wed and the new smarpthone designs they introduced in NYC, RIM was perceived by many as too late to now compete with Apple and Google/Android since together they own about 85% of the current smartphone market. </p>
<p>This fact is still true. Apple and Google’s market position in smartphones continues to grow and makes it hard for another smartphone OS to compete even if it is an innovative and solid offering. That said, I do believe that if a third or fourth mobile OS could compete it could be BB 10 and the market needs this extra competition for three reasons.</p>
<h4>Competition is Healthy</h4>
<p>First, competition is good for consumers since it sits at the heart of innovation. Although RIM will always be playing catch up, the fact that there is another OS that is really solid and competitive will only force Apple and Google to try harder and to innovate faster.</p>
<p>Second, it makes it more difficult for government officials to ever go after Apple or Google for monopolistic practices. While Microsoft and Nokia helped take some of the regulatory pressure off of Apple and Google, RIM only broadens the competitive landscape even if they only get a small share of the market in the future.</p>
<p>The third reason we need RIM is that there is a segment of the market that needs ultra secure devices and specialized email servers that RIM or Blackberry excels in. Apple and Google/Android has shown significant progress in providing secure email and an app environment but in some accounts they are still considered too weak for some with ultra secure email needs. </p>
<p>My Tech.pinions colleague, John Kirk, <a href="http://techpinions.com/blackberry-the-charge-of-the-light-brigade/14112" title="Blackberry: The Charge Of The Light Brigade">wrote a brilliant piece Thursday</a> that lays out why Apple has won so much territory in the smart phone wars. He concludes that for Blackberry to be considered even remotely successful it had to be superior to what Apple and Google already has offered the marketplace.</p>
<p>Here lies my real concern for Blackberry and their new OS and phones.  For all intent and purposes, it is a me too product that is barely equal to Apple’s iOS and iPhone offerings, and brings nothing new or superior to the smartphone table. When I saw the demos and looked closely at especially the BB Z 10, it looked pretty much like an iPhone 5 or a Samsung Galaxy SIII.</p>
<p>While the new OS is excellent and runs some existing Android apps and will most likely get some support for native BB 10 apps, it brings nothing really significant to the table other than its reputation for providing highly secure email.</p>
<p>I don’t believe BB 10 has any real chance of catching up with either Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android. In fact, I suspect that if they have any success it will be in a niche area where extremely secure email tops the list of things needed in a smartphone platform. </p>
<p>Personally, I hope they do become competitive and over time deliver some innovations that set them apart from the competition. But I am willing to bet that when we look at the charts that layout smartphone market numbers later this year, Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android platforms together maintain at least 75-80% of that market. That leaves Microsoft and Blackberry to duke it out for the other 20% or so and a combined marketing effort from Microsoft and Nokia in 2013 could tip the balance in their favor.</p>
<p>I applaud Blackberry’s commitment to stay in the smartphone game given the beating they have taken over the last five years. However, if anyone thinks that their new OS and their new smartphones will cause Apple or Google any real headaches, they would be mistaken. At best, Blackberry can continue to compete in a market that is dominated by Apple and Google and their partners but I am very doubtful that they will have the kind of success they hope for in light of the momentum their competitors have in today’s smartphone market. </p>

<p>One of the most striking features of much tech writing today is its near total ignorance about corporate software and systems. Except for sites like ComputerWorld and others that specialize in the enterprise, reporting is sparse and when it appears, often wrong.</p>
<p>This tendency has been glaringly revealed in a lot of the writing about the new BlackBerry and the BlackBerry 10 operating system. The heart of the blackBerry business has always been the enterprise and the company&#8217;s hopes for revival hinge on its ability to win back customers who have been drifting to other platforms or bring-your-own-device options. But consider this from <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/31/the-blackberry-diaspora/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In short, BB10 isn&#8217;t built for the way business is done today. When RIM was in its ascendance there weren&#8217;t many options for an IT guy. You could install Exchange, sendmail, or Lotus and wait for a crash. BES was a godsend. Now that’s no longer true. 99.9% uptime is the rule, not the exception, and there are hundreds of cloud service providers that can turn a single founder into a mobile powerhouse from the comfort of her phone – her iOS phone.</p></blockquote>
<p>The writer, the usually solid John Biggs, doesn&#8217;t realize that BlackBerry Enterprise Server was never an alternative to Microsoft Exchange or Lotus Notes. It ran (or runs) on top of one of those platforms. BES may have been a godsend, but not for that reason. And major commercial mail platforms such as Exchange or Lotus Domino Mail have provided three nines of uptime for a very long time. and to the extent that I can understand that last sentence, there have been cloud providers for a very long time too, including those that offer hosted BES services.</p>
<p>BlackBerry is making a serious play to regain the corporate market, BlackBerry Enterprise Service 10, released last week, provides two new services: BlackBerry Balance, a software approach that partitions a BlackBerry 10 devices into separate  business and personal halves, and BlackBerry World for Work, a custom corporate app store. It also brings messaging and mobile device management support to Android and iOS devices, as well as BlackBerry 10s.</p>
<p>BlackBerry faces huge challenges and its success in the enterprise is far from assured. But if you want to analyze its chances, it helps to know how this stuff actually works.</p>

Tech.Pinions columnist, Steve Wildstrom, is <a href="http://techpinions.com/cheering-for-blackberry/13990">cheering for Blackberry</a> as are many Tech.Pinion regular readers and millions upon millions of others. Does the new, re-invented, Blackberry stand a chance? Or is Blackberry merely metaphorically repeating the infamous charge of the Light Brigade? In order to answer that question, let&#8217;s look at some computing history.</p>
<h4>The Personal Computer</h4>
<p>In the late seventies and eighties, at the dawn of the age of personal computing, there were scores of different competing computers and computing operating systems. By the eighties, things had begun to shake out. One by one, computers like the TRS-80, Commodore 64, Apple II, Atari ST, Amiga and others took their final bows and left the stage forever. By 1995 the only two players left standing were computers powered by Windows and the Mac. And as many of you know, the Mac was barely standing. </p>
<p>From that day until this, no one has seriously challenged Windows&#8217; leadership in personal computing. For almost three decades, Mac aficionados have insisted that theirs is the superior operating system. Did that help the Mac overcome Window&#8217;s dominance and secure the personal computing crown for itself? No it did not.</p>
<p>On February 19, 1996, in an interview with Fortune, Steve Jobs said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The PC wars are over. Done. Microsoft won a long time ago.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He was right.</p>
<p>LESSON #1: HAVING THE BEST HARDWARE AND/OR OPERATING SYSTEM IS NO GUARANTEE OF VICTORY.</p>
<p>LESSON #2: ONCE A PLATFORM IS ENTRENCHED, IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO DISLODGE.</p>
<h4>The MP3</h4>
<p>In the self-same Fortune interview referred to above, Steve Jobs also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If I were running Apple, I would milk the Macintosh for all it&#8217;s worth &#8212; and get busy on the next great thing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And that&#8217;s exactly what Steve Jobs did when he returned to Apple. Apple continues to milk the Mac to this day. And their next great thing was &#8211; the iPod.</p>
<p>In the late nineties, there were several companies competing to win the nascent MP3 wars. In 2001, Apple introduced the iPod, but it was really the one-two combination of the iPod and iTunes that eventually won the day. iTunes helped store, organize and deliver your music to your iPod and the it was the iPod &#8211; with its clean hardware, its easy to understand user interface and its easy to use click wheel &#8211; that helped you to easily find your music and play it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Do not renew an attack along the same line (or in the same form) after it has once failed.&#8221; ~ B.H. Liddel. Hart, Strategy</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand two things here. First, the iPod was not a direct attack on Microsoft Windows. Far from it. In military terms, you don&#8217;t conduct a frontal assault against a well-entrenched enemy. In business terms, you don&#8217;t defeat the industry standard bearer just by being a little better &#8212; or even a lot better &#8212; at what you do. The Mac has been attacking Windows since 1984 and it still has only 5% to 10% market share to show for its efforts. (True, the Mac&#8217;s consolation prize is that it may garner as much as 35% of the sector&#8217;s profits, but that still does not make the Mac anywhere near the industry standard.) </p>
<p>Second, Apple did not win the MP3 wars simply by being better than the existing players from Sony, Archos and others. With the iPod/iTunes combo, Apple leap-frogged the existing market and created a whole new category of device. It was the synchronization of iTunes with the iPod that was its killer feature. And despite all the criticism that iTunes deservedly receives, no other competitor has come close to duplicating its functionality. In military terms, Apple created a whole new front. In business terms, Apple created a whole new category. And once Apple established itself as the standard for the new MP3 category, they never let go their grip. To this day, Apple dominates the MP3 market with over 70% market share and gawd-knows-how-much profit share.</p>
<p>Sony, Archos and others tried to unseat the iPod by providing cheaper devices with more features. Didn&#8217;t happen. </p>
<p>Microsoft came late to the MP3 game but they came with what they, and most industry observers, thought was the winning strategy. With PlaysForSure, Microsoft intended to duplicate, in MP3&#8242;s, the same success that they were enjoying in personal computing. Microsoft would create the operating system, license it to manufacturers and then watch as their open licensing system inevitably overwhelmed Apple&#8217;s closed operating system. Didn&#8217;t happen. </p>
<p>After a while, Microsoft tired of not gaining any market share (or any profits), threw their PlaysForSure partners under the bus, and created the Zune. (Kind of reminds me of how Microsoft is handling the Surface. But I digress.) It&#8217;s hard to remember now, but most industry observers predicted that the Zune was the beginning of the end for Apple and the iPod. At that time, Apple was a mere upstart and Microsoft was the 900 pound gorilla that everyone feared. What Microsoft wanted, Microsoft took. With the weight of Microsoft behind the Zune, how could it fail to become the industry standard? Didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>LESSON #3: WHEN IT COMES TO PLATFORMS AND STANDARDS, TIMING MATTERS. THE FIRST MOVER AND THE FAST FOLLOWER HAVE THE INSIDE TRACK. THE REST JUST REMAIN AT THE BACK OF THE PACK.</p>
<h4>The Smartphone</h4>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Do not throw your weight into a stroke whilst your opponent is on guard.&#8221; ~ B.H. Liddel. Hart, Strategy</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2006, Smartphones were ruled by the Palm, Windows, RIM and Nokia. In 2007, Apple introduced the iPhone. By 2013, Palm was gone, Windows Mobile was gone, Nokia was a niche player, dependent upon Microsoft&#8217;s new mobile operating system, and RIM was making a bold gamble to regain relevance. What&#8217;s important to understand is that Apple&#8217;s iPhone was not, as many thought, a more expensive smartphone. Rather, it was an inexpensive pocket computer. Apple did not really make a better smartphone. Instead, they opened a new front, created a whole new category of device, and then dominated that category. Google did an excellent job of fast following with Android and now, between them, Apple&#8217;s iOS and Google&#8217;s Android sell more than 90% of all smartphones.</p>
<p>Within a year after the introduction of the iPhone, Palm tried to reinvent themselves, but they lacked the resources to make it happen. Windows Mobile re-invented itself into Windows Phone 7, and again into Windows phone 8, and what has that gotten Microsoft? Perhaps 3% market share? Microsoft has all the resources in the world. They have tremendous business connections. They&#8217;re patient and persistent. And their Windows Phone operating system is well-respected. Yet they can&#8217;t seem to gain any traction in the phone market. If Microsoft, with all its advantages and with a four year head start, can&#8217;t gain any traction in the smartphone markets, then what realistic chance does Blackberry have?</p>
<p>LESSON #4: YOU DON&#8217;T OVERCOME A MARKET LEADER THROUGH A DIRECT ASSAULT. YOU FLANK THEM.</p>
<h4>The Tablet</h4>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Exploit the line of least resistance &#8211; so long as it can lead you to any objective which old contribute to your underlying object.&#8221; ~ B.H. Liddell Hart, Strategy</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2001, Bill Gates was touting the advantages of the tablet. Yet in 2010, it took Apple only 7 months to sell more tablets than Microsoft had been able to sell in the previous 10 years. Did Apple do this by simply making a better tablet? No. Apple re-invented the tablet market by adding instant-on, longer battery life and a capacitive touch screen. But most of all, Apple re-invented the tablet by creating a wholly new touch user interface. Apple didn&#8217;t improve on the existing Microsoft tablets. They created a new category of device with a wholly new operating system.</p>
<p>By 1995, Microsoft&#8217;s Windows dominated personal computing, never to be challenged again. Neither Apple nor any other contender ever did or ever will unseat Windows from its dominant position. Instead, Apple created a new market and dominated it. By attacking Microsoft where it was weakest, Apple did in 7 months in tablets what it could not do in 20 years in personal computers.</p>
<p>LESSON #5: THE ART OF WAR IS THE ART OF AVOIDING A DIRECT ASSAULT AND IMPLEMENTING AN INDIRECT APPROACH TO ONE&#8217;S ENEMY. THE ART OF BUSINESS IS THE ART OF AVOIDING THE DIRECT ASSAULT AGAINST A COMPETITOR&#8217;S STRENGTHS AND LEVERAGING ONE&#8217;S STRENGTHS AGAINST A COMPETITOR&#8217;S WEAKNESSES.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<blockquote><p>Theirs not to make reply,<br />
Theirs not to reason why,<br />
Theirs but to do and die:<br />
Into the valley of Death</p>
<p>~ Alfred, Lord Tennyson, The Charge of the Light Brigade</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://techpinions.com/blackberry-the-charge-of-the-light-brigade/14112/images-41-2" rel="attachment wp-att-14122"><img src="http://techpinions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/images-41.jpeg" alt="images-41" width="259" height="194" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14122" /></a><br />
Do I hate Blackberry or wish them ill? Absolutely not. I have tremendous respect for what they&#8217;ve done. The original Blackberry phones were category busters and a wonder to behold. But the truth is, it does not matter if the Blackberry 10 hardware and software are narrowly better than the iPhone or Android phones. They have to be so superior that customers will be willing to switch. Because remaining the number four, or even the number three, smartphone OS is not going to cut it with developers. And people don&#8217;t switch platforms unless the alternative is not just superior but FAR superior to their current platform. Just ask the Mac, the Zune, and Windows Phone 7.</p>
<p>If you want to argue that a fast follower can overtake a first mover, I will agree. If you want to argue that the Blackberry 10 &#8211; introduced over 6 years after the iPhone was introduced &#8211; is a fast follower, I will respectfully disagree.</p>
<p>In war, you don&#8217;t win a frontal assault unless you have overwhelming military superiority. The art of war is, in part, about how to avoid making frontal assaults. In business, you don&#8217;t win a war against an establised standard unless you have overwhelming product superiority. The art of business is, in part, about differentiating your product and advancing your strengths against your competitor&#8217;s weaknesses.</p>
<p>Blackberry is not creating a new front or a new category. They&#8217;re attacking the existing leaders where they are entrenched and strongest. Does anyone honestly think that the Blackberry 10 is so superior to the iPhone, Android phones and Windows Phone 8 that it will overwhelm any of them?

<p>After what seemed like an interminable pregnancy, BlackBerry (the new corporate name; Research In Motion is history) delivered some very nice hardware running an impressive new operating system. The  all-touch Z10 is available immediately in Great Britain, next week in Canada and in March in the U.S. The Q10, with a traditional BlackBerry keyboard, is due in April.</p>
<p>The new products have a lot to offer. The Z10 looks pretty much like  every contemporary  smartphone&#8211;a black slab with a 4.2&#8243; display that puts is between the  iPhone 5 and the somewhat bigger run of Android handsets. But it features a unique gesture-driven, messaging-centric operating system that combines some of the better features of the late, lamented webOS and Windows Phone 8 and which is its main selling point. Unlike the painful compromises of previous BlackBerry software, the QNX-based BlackBerry 10 is fully touch-optimized and is fluid and highly responsive. Its gestures take a bit of learning, but not very much.</p>
<p>But the new BlackBerry is not going to sell itself in a world thoroughly dominated by iPhone and Android. And the marketing message at BlackBerry&#8217;s Jan. 30 launch event was a bit muddled. It&#8217;s an old truism in marketing that if you are trying to sell to everyone, you are targeting no one and the BlackBerry approach seems somewhat unfocused.</p>
<p>One symptom of that was the announcement that Alicia Keyes would be BlackBerry&#8217;s  new creative director, but it was far from clear what her task is. Asked about it at a press conference, she offered something vague about increasing its appeal to the entertainment industry and to women. But one market is too narrowand the other too diffuse to be addressed meaningfully. I suspect Keyes will have about as much impact for BlackBerry as the Black-eyed Peas&#8217; will.i.am has had in a similar role at Intel.</p>
<p>To have a chance of success (which I define, at least initially, as beating out Microsoft to become the No. 3 smartphone platform, a definition BlackBerry seems to share), the new phones have to win over several key markets.</p>
<p><b>The Die-hards. </b>The  core of dedicated BlackBerry users still hanging on to their Bolds and Torches are the lowest-hanging fruit.  BlackBerry has to migrate them to the new platform as quickly as possible. They will be helped in this effort by the fact that radical as the new software is, it maintains a certain essential BlackBerry-ness. An example: I was annoyed by the fact that the mail program asked for confirmation each time  wanted to delete a message. But I found the toggle to turn that off exacty where I, as a longtime BlackBerry user, expected it to be.</p>
<p><b>The BYOD Crowd. </b>This is a much tougher audience. Corporate IT managers, while grumbling about the traditional cost of BlackBerry services, have always liked having a  platform that offered unified management and proven security. But they had been forced to accept the iPhones and Androids that esxecutives have brought into the system and now must manage a melange of devices. They are prime targets for BlackBerry but winning them over win&#8217;t matter un less marketers can also win back the execs who adandoned BlackBerry in the first  place. One thing that will help is BlackBerry Balance, software that devides a device into a secure business partition and an open personal partition. Another, which could win me mover, is the integration of Evernote, the invaluable note-taking cloud service, into it Remember app, a sort of a cross between OneNote and Tripit.</p>
<p><strong>The Message-centric.</strong> BlackBerry has always been primarily about messaging and the new versions do not ignore that heritage. While the rest of the system has been greatly beefed up, messaging remains paramount. If you are the sort of person who wants to know right away when an email message or a response to a tweet comes in&#8211;and want quick and easy access to it, the new BlackBerry is for you. The BlackBerry Hub, a central feature of the user interface, is the ultimate unified inbox. Marketing built around the BlackBerry&#8217;s messaging prowess could win over this audience.</p>
<p>BlackBerry has all the other smartphone bases covered, but not generally in a way that makes it a must have. The supply of available apps, somewhere between 70,000 and 100,000 depending on who was talking and when, is pretty good for the launch of a new system. Most of the  major categories are covered and those that are missing, including Netflix, HBO Go, and Instagram, are rumored to be not that far off. BlackBerry made it relatively easy for developers to port Android apps to BB10, and approach that accounts for about 40% of the initial offerings. The camera is good enough to be competitive, but isn&#8217;t a reason anyone will buy a BlackBerry.</p>
<p>One large group of current BlackBerry customers that will not be served by the new phones is the millions of buyers&#8211;many in emerging markets&#8211;of inexpensive Curves for whom the biggest attraction is BlackBerry Messenger. The Z10 and Q10 are expected to sell for around $200 on a two-year contract in the U.S., and if BlackBerry has plans to come up with a low-cost model for the Curve market, they aren;t talking about it yet.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that BlackBerry has given it a really good shot. To increase their chances of success in a very tough market, they need to refine their message and focus their marketing tightly on the groups they need to win.</p>

<p>I was headed to New York for the BlackBerry 10 launch and took the first train on the Washington Metro Red Line to connect with the 6 am Acela at Union Station. The trip proceeded uneventfully to the Metro Center station downtown, where we sat, and sat and sat. Finally, they put us off the train and it headed out without passengers. At no time was there any useful communication with passengers, other than the order to get off.</p>
<p>What was a tight connection became an impossible one and despite hitting Union Station at a dead run, I got to the gate just after they closed the doors. I had sent several tweets on the situation, all using Metro&#8217;s #wmata hashtag but saw no response.</p>
<p>Then came the interesting part. After settling down to wait for the 7 am Acela, I got a response from @Amtrak reminding me to change my ticket for the later train. The only mention I had made of Amtrak was a tweet, without the &#8220;@,&#8221; complaining about the endlessly looping security video.</p>
<p>Metro, which uses a Twitter account to post often stale information about its unceasing delays and breakdowns, does not seem to have any interest in a dialog with customers. (Actually, Metro seems to regard itself primarily as an employment program for its workers, who avoid interactions with riders at all costs. If they succeed in moving some passengers, that&#8217;s a coincidental benefit.)</p>
<p>Amtrak, by contrast, seems to monitor Twitter aggressively and respond quickly, even when a response isn&#8217;t really required. I ride Amtrak to New York fairly frequently, but I&#8217;ve never had strong feelings about it, other than that it is preferable to flying Delta or US Airways or taking the bus. But that little tweet this morning made me feel that someone cared, even if it was only an AI bot.</p>
<p>The lesson here is clear. If you are going to have a presence on social media, you create an expectation of real communication. A little effort can go a long way, and the lack of effort can easily antagonize customers you could easily please (or at least defuse their anger.)</p>

<p>A lot has been written lately about &#8220;exponential growth,&#8221; nearly all of it wrong. If you want to see what real exponential growth looks like, check out the graph of Apple&#8217;s revenues and profits . And this tells an important story about Apple the commentators, including financial analysts who should know much better, have completely missed. Explosive growth over the past few years has transformed Apple from a scrappy underdog into one of the largest companies in the world&#8211;it should break into the top 10 of the <em>Fortune </em>500 this year. And things become very different when you get this big.</p>
<p>Of course Apple&#8217;s growth is slowing down. The thing about exponential growth is that it is inherently unstable and unsustainable. If Apple continued along its a 2005-2012 growth track until 2016, its annual sales would be nearly a trillion dollars, a clear impossibility. In fact, the single most remarkable thing about Apple is that it managed to sail smoothly through a growth spurt that would have destroyed many companies. And this all the more remarkable because it simultaneously went through the transfer of leadership from the late Steve Jobs to Tim Cook.</p>
<p>Regardless of how quickly Apple grows over the next few years, the growth that has already occurred has transformed the company in ways that both its fans and its critics ignore. The Apple that introduced the iPhone in 2007 was a middling-sized company with $24 billion in sales and 24,000 employees. It was a cheeky upstart in the phone business, a fifth the size of the AT&amp;T with which it drove a hard bargain to be the exclusive carrier of the iPhone at launch.</p>
<p>Lots of things happen happen to a company when it grows this big, most of them bad. A certain amount of bureaucracy is just required to keep the wheels turning. Corporate functions, such as human resources and legal, swell. Apple seems to have done a splendid job of keeping the bloat that comes with rapid growth under tight control; amazingly Apple&#8217;s employment tripled in a period when its sales increased six-fold (meaning, of course, that sales per employee doubled, a spectacular accomplishment.) Above all, the bigger you get, the harder it is to maintain a rapid rate of growth because the absolute size of the increase you must generate explodes.<span class="pullquote">Apple seems to have done a splendid job of keeping the bloat that comes with rapid growth under tight control.</span></p>
<p>In  fiscal 2007, Apple sold 7 million Macs, 51.6 million iPods, and 1.4 million iPhones. In fiscal 2012, it sold 18 million Macs, 35 million iPods, 125 million iPhones, and 58 million iPads. One thing that stood out in Apple&#8217;s  &#8220;disappointing&#8221;  first quarter of fiscal 2013 is that sales of the iPhone and iPad were constrained by supply. The supply chain appears to have fallen a bit short, but given the growth experienced, it&#8217;s a wonder that the supply chain is functioning at all. Think of the number of components that had to be purchased, assembly lines that had to be brought on stream, and finished product that had to be shipped, often half way around the world, to accommodate that growth. And all of this was accomplished without any evidence of the quality problems that usually accompany rapid expansion. The supply issues of the past couple of quarters were probably inevitable; they do not diminish the reputation Tim Cook has earned as a supply chain genius for managing the growth.</p>
<p>What mostly needs adjusting is expectations for Apple. All the speculation about whether Apple has lost is mojo, or its cool, or whatever fails to consider that what Apple has lost is its ability to grow quickly, not because of anything its management is doing wrong but as a function of pure size. Look at it this way. From its 2010 introduction through fiscal 2012,  the iPad generated about $57 billion in revenue, about half of Apple&#8217;s total revenue growth through the period. But for a hypothetical new product to make a similar contribution over the next three years, it would have to be twice as successful as the iPad in dollar value terms. That&#8217;s not likely to happen.</p>
<p>What does all of this mean for Apple&#8217;s stock price, the source of so much angst of late? The odd thing is that even when Apple was growing most rapidly and its share price was rising quickly, the market didn&#8217;t act as though it expected the growth continue. The ration of the stock price to trailing 12-month earnings last year peaked at just a bit over 15, very low for a company whose sales and earnings were growing phenomenally quickly.</p>
<p>The market was right: The growth had to slow. But even though the stock was priced seemingly in anticipation of slower growth, investors responded to the seeming reality of a slowdown by driving the price down so hard that the P/E fell below 10 (it has since recovered a bit along with the stock price.) There may have been plenty of reasons for the stock price to stop going up, but none but emotion for a 30% decline.</p>
<p>None of which is to say anything about where the price will go next. Markets will do what they do. Apple remains an extraordinarily well-managed  company with a very strong product portfolio and, I suspect, the ability to surprise us again with new and innovative products. But I doubt that we will ever see another spurt of growth like the past five years. Apple has just plain gotten too big for that to happen.</p>

My goal here is provide some insights into how an American, technically astute Apple iPhone user would feel about using Windows Phone 8.  I don’t represent the masses, but do represent the demographics of a an influential block of analysts, press, pundits, etc.  I will talk about the pros, cons, and things that just didn’t matter one way or the other when comparing my iPhone 4s to the Windows Phone 8 powered Nokia Lumia 920.  The 920 is considered by most as the flagship Windows Phone 8 phone and a good representation of the state of the art.</p>
<p>Let’s start out with the Windows Phone 8 (WP8) plusses.</p>
<h2><b>Windows Phone 8 Plusses</b></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Camera: </i></b>While I know this has more to do with Nokia than WP8, it’s important to talk about it as it’s such a core feature.  To be fair, when I am bragging on iOS, I always talk about the iPhone camera.  Flat out, the 920 has the best camera I have ever used.  It has superior low light capability and nearly every picture was in focus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Responsiveness:</i></b>  Amongst Android and iOS, WP8 is by far the most responsive operating system.  Screen flows are elegant and very rarely, if ever, did I feel any stutter.  This says a lot given the immaturity of WP8.  It also says a lot about how helpful restricting true multitasking can be.  I’ll touch on that later.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Live Tiles:</i></b> Instead of icons, WP8 uses Live Tiles, or large icons that display information without actually having to open the app.  The most useful tiles were mail, calendar, and weather.  It was nice to just look at my phone and get a glance at the latest email and appointment without having to open multiple apps or down-swipe a notifications bar.  Sure, it only saves a few seconds, but our minds amplify time savings, so it feels like a lot more.  It also helps in the car, too where I can glance at my phone at a stop light and see what&#8217;s going on.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Stability:</i></b> Flat out, WP8 never crashed nor did any app I was using.  I find this absolutely amazing, given the immaturity of the OS.  I cannot say the same about iOS 6 or Jelly Bean.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Contact linking:</i></b> I liked this about webOS and I like it about WP8.  I have close to 7 social media or email accounts. WP8 (like Windows 8/RT) allows you to link contacts together so instead of seeing up to 7 contacts for one person, you see only one.  Some of the Android shells do this, but WP8 is flat-out superior at it.  It&#8217;s nice, too, that the linking gets shared to Windows 8 and Windows RT devices.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Calendar and contacts:</i></b> WP8’s calendar worked really well with Google services, but not as well as Android, of course.  It supported adding attendees, accepting meeting notices from Outlook, etc.  Contact sharing with Google was flawless.   This is an area of intense weakness for iOS and I hope to see improve quickly.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>The “back” button:</i></b> Having a back button may sound like a nit, but it is a genuine time saver versus iOS.  iOS requires the double tap on the home button and a selection of the app versus just tapping the back button.  I was surprised at just how much I liked this.  When you hold the back button down for a second, your a screenshot of your last used apps pops up and I really liked that.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Internet Explorer browser:</i></b> Very simply, the browser worked on all sites and was very fast, and in fact it felt faster than both Safari and even Chrome.  That’s saying a lot.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Full email search:</i></b> WP8 allows me to do a full search of my email, where iOS just enables people and email title search.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Spell check:</i></b> Unlike iOS and Android, WP8 gets it right for me more times than not and automatically makes the change.  This was one of those &#8220;wow I didn&#8217;t know it could get better&#8221; features.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>People App:</strong></em> This app is unique in that you can organize people into groups, like Favorites and Family and see real-time info on them, like their social media updates, uploaded pictures and comments.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Full photo and video uploads:</strong></em> Unlike iCloud and iOS, WP8 uploads full size photos and even videos to SkyDrive.  To keep battery and broadband fees to a minimum, WP8 gives you the option to only upload over WiFi.  This is awesome as I never need to connect my phone to my PC, which I could never say about my iPhone.</p>
<p>Now let’s move onto the areas that didn’t make a difference one way or another.</p>
<h2><b>Windows Phone 8 Neutrals</b></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Copy-Paste:</i></b> Unlike Android, WP8’s  copy and paste worked nearly as good as iOS.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>MS Office:</i></b> With WP8, MS Office files can be flawlessly read and Word and Excel can be editred.  As iOS has decent Office “read” capabilities, this brought nothing to the table, so I am indifferent.  When I was doing more &#8220;Powerpointing&#8221; in corporate America, iOS did make grievous mistakes with many Powerpoint files.  Seriously, who edits Excel on their phone?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Multitasking:</strong></em> As far as I can tell, there is no way for the user to control multitasking at any fine grain level.  Mail, calendar, and social media will sync in the background, but many apps won&#8217;t, and it&#8217;s aggravating.  Therefore, I must have the following apps open to sync data: Evernote, SlapDash Podcasts, and even Skydrive.  This is a &#8220;neutral&#8221; because iPhone isn&#8217;t much better with user controlled multitasking.</p>
<h2><b>Windows Phone 8 Minuses</b></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>“Page 1” Apps:</i></b> WP8 lacks in many cases the apps and the depth of apps I want on my phone.  First, there were many apps that were just as good and in some cases better than iOS.  Facebook, LinkedIn, E*Trade, Netflix and Evernote fall into that category.   Many of my preferred apps lacked full functionality, though.  These were apps like Epicurious, Flixster, Yelp and ESPN ScoreCenter which didn’t enable me to login and import saved data or settings.  YouTube wouldn&#8217;t let me even upload a video.  The most difficult thing to deal with was some of the lack of my page 1 apps.  These are apps like WatchESPN, Neat, Nike Run, HootSuite, Instagram, Google+, TripCase, Waze, MailOnline, TWC TV, and Pulse.  I use these daily on my iPhone and they were really hard to live without.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>App organization:</i></b> There are two distinct places consumers can organize tiles; the home screen and app screen.  The app screen is a vertical string of apps that is endless.  If you’re like me and use over 100 apps you are left with a string of endless apps to wade through.   This is ridiculous and needs to change. (UPDATE: In app window, holding down a letter will bring up the alphabet where users can pick apps that start with that letter.  Still harder than folders IMO.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><strong>Lack of synced bookmarks:</strong></em> I liked the speed and compatibility of Internet Explorer, but the lack of synced bookmarks felt archaic. In fact, there are no folders for favorites and like lack of an organizing principle for apps, leaves a huge, long and unmanageable list of links.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Phone search:</i></b> I really like the phone Spotlight Search on iOS.  WP8 doesn’t have the capability and I missed it.  What compounds the problem is that there aren’t app folders and I want to search for installed apps.  Contacts were tough too, because it could take three clicks to search on a contact as I need to go into People, find &#8220;all&#8221; people, press magnifying glass, then type in person&#8217;s name.  The frustrating this is that one of three dedicated bezel buttons is search, but it&#8217;s just a Bing search.  I wish they would change that to a phone search.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><b><i>Maps and nav:</i></b> Apple Maps severely disappointed me because of the inaccurate or incomplete data, but it had a killer experience. Nokia Maps was the opposite; decent data with a challenging experience.  I must caveat that Nokia maps is still beta and it shows. First, most of the times, GPS got stuck for about 10 seconds before it could tell me where I was.  That was more of my impatience, but it felt forever when you’re trying to find out where you are or how to get some place.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">About 25% of the time when I did go to turn-by-turn directions, the phone got confused and wouldn’t do turn-by-turn or any navigation.  It would just sit there, confused.  Finally, when voice directions did say where to go, Nokia maps doesn’t give street names, it uses generics. It will say, “turn right in 1 mile”, not something like “turn right in 1 mile at Main Street.”  This was very, very difficult when you&#8217;re driving 65 mph on the highway in a big city when exits are packed on top of each other.  I missed many turns because of it.  I hope during their beta period, Nokia saw others recognizes this and made appropriate changes.</p>
<p><b><i>Switching to Windows 8?</i></b></p>
<p>I was really impressed with WP8 “feel”, stability and the camera.  Yes, that camera was a real differentiator.  The challenge is there are way too many shortcomings with lack of apps, maps &amp; navigation, and browser bookmark sync for me to make a switch.  When some of the basics are there, I would reconsider, but then again, there will be a new set of &#8220;basics&#8221; in a year.  I won&#8217;t switch from iOS to Windows Phone 8 for now but will now likely switch to Android.  I want to see what Mobile World Congress before I lock into a phone and I will keep you posted on that.</p>

I go to CES mostly to meet with our clients, gather data and market intelligence, and search for trends. CES always includes hidden gems; you simply have to know where to look.</p>
<p>Two things stood out to me as major themes at CES this year.</p>
<h4>The Internet of Things on Display</h4>
<p>We have talked about the concept of the Internet of Things for several years now. The Internet of Things is the idea that the vast majority of our electronics will be connected to the Internet and/or other nearby devices.</p>
<p>A refrigerator, for example, may have a touch screen on the door and be connected to the Internet, allowing you to remotely access information — things like inventory, temperature, whether or not you have what you need to make a certain recipe. Another example is the Nest thermostat, which is a connected thermostat that allows you to remotely manage your thermostat from your smartphone, tablet or PC. The high-level view of the Internet of Things is a world where nearly every electronic device we own will be connected to something.</p>
<p>In years past, this idea was just an idea — something we said was coming. This year, however, was the first year when I could actually say the Internet of Things was on display. I saw examples of nearly every type of electronics device — from coffee makers, ovens, fridges, cars, clocks, stereos, exercise equipment, and my personal favorite: an LED lightbulb with a wireless speaker built in. All of these devices were connected to the Internet and allowed you to interact with them, store data, access data and more. This was the first year I could see the Internet of Things becoming reality, and it is very exciting for us industry observers.</p>
<p>I’m half-joking but I can’t wait for the year when we see a connected toilet and companion app.</p>
<h4>Hardware with Software Accessories</h4>
<p>The reality of the Internet of Things coming to fruition brings with it perhaps one of the most interesting developments: the role of software. What become increasingly evident with all the connected devices I saw and played with at CES was that nearly all of them were made significantly more usable and valuable through the use of companion apps for smartphones or tablets.</p>
<p>Some I have spoken with position devices such as connected watches or even the Nest thermostat as accessories to your smartphone. The logic is that because your smartphone is the terminal that all these devices leverage to really make them smart, then the phone must have the more important role. This is true to some degree, because there is no point of having all these connected devices if the experiences are limited to the hardware itself. However, I would still position the hardware as the stand-alone device adding value, while the app on your smartphone is actually the accessory.</p>
<p>At CES, this hardware-software model was on full display in the area of smart health and personal sensors.  On the show floor, the pavilion for the smart/connected health area was the biggest I have ever seen it: Several dozen vendors were there showing off the latest in smart health. Every single smart health and body sensor product I got a demo of or gathered info on had a companion app that ran on a smartphone, making the hardware more than just hardware.</p>
<p>This is the world we are headed toward. Because of the unrivaled momentum and rapid worldwide adoption of devices like smartphones and tablets, we have smart devices with us at all times. They perfectly function as the platform to drive the interaction with the hardware around us.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Research In Motion will launch its bid to save itself with the redesigned from the ground up BlackBerry. I&#8217;ll be at the launch event and I will judge the new hardware and software on their merits, still I have to admit that I am cheering for a BlackBerry comeback.</p>
<p>Apple reinvented the smartphone in 2007, but before that, the most important smartphone innovations came from Palm and RIM. Palm&#8217;s Treo (actually, the original version came from Handspring, a company started by Palm&#8217;s founders and later merged back into Palm) invented the concept of integrating a mobile phone and a PDA, along with third-party apps. The original BlackBerry, which was not a phone, created true mobile email and calendar. Eventually, this all came together to create the modern smartphone, which Apple took to the next level with the iPhone.</p>
<p>The iPhone did in Palm and nearly killed RIM. The decline of Palm was inevitable. The company was always cursed  by under-financing and a lack of stable, competent management. When Apple turned up the heat, Palm lacked the wherewithal to respond successfully with its reinvention after its purchase by Elevation Partners was too little, too late. Its demise after a horribly bungled acquisition by Hewlett-Packard was a somehow fitting  ending to a very sad tale.</p>
<p>RIM is a very different story. Palm knew what was happening to it but couldn&#8217;t do much about it. RIM, riding high as BlackBerry sales continued to soar well into the iPhone era, but lacked the paranoia than Intel&#8217;s Andy Grove long ago pointed out was a key to survival in a highly competitive industry. RIM co-CEOs Michael Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie were convinced of the superiority of their product and their business model and failed to respond to the market&#8217;s shift toward demanding highly capable handheld computers, not glorified messaging devices.</p>
<p>Fortunately, RIM, unlike Palm, had deep financial resources and significant annuity revenue streams that bought it another chance. It has two reservoirs of strength, the popularity of its low-end devices in emerging markets (where volume sales can be had, but profits are scarce) and enterprises, especially governments and others with the greatest concern about security. Success in neither is a given, but the opportunities exist. And I&#8217;ll admit to a long-standing fondness for RIM, particularly Mike Lazaridis&#8217; uncontained enthusiasm when he talked about his newest BlackBerry or showed off a lab at RIM&#8217;s Waterloo, Ont., headquarters.</p>
<p>I think that both Android and Apple would benefit from some additional competition. Microsoft, despite heroic efforts, has so far failed to win much traction in the mobile market. Had Windows Phone and Windows RT taken off, there wouldn&#8217;t be much room for a RIM comeback. But they haven&#8217;t, so there is. It&#8217;s going to take a spectacularly good product to succeed in this tough neighborhood. I&#8217;m hoping that RIM still has it in them.</p>

I am not a financial analyst and my research is not directed at those making stock bets. Yet if I was to put myself in the shoes of a financial analyst or someone looking to make long term bets on tech companies, I would have to wonder what company is a better long term bet than Apple? In my opinion there isn’t one.</p>
<p>I do industry analysis and not financial analysis, however, my work often results in very company specific analysis. I do quite a bit of scenario planning as it helps guide our trend and strategy reports. I can say with quite a bit of confidence that as I survey all the current players in the technology industry, Apple is the one I worry the least about. In fact my only concern for Apple is that they are having trouble keeping up with demand. Their earnings call revealed that Apple was supply constrained in almost every product category. Apple could not make enough products fast enough.</p>
<p>What other company has this problem? Apple has this problem in the tens of millions of devices per quarter range and in the foreseeable future hundreds of millions of devices per quarter. The level of scale for the precision engineering of Apple hardware is unprecedented in consumer electronics. I can’t think of a single more elegantly designed piece of hardware that was mass manufactured to the degree of the iPhone.</p>
<p>I remain confident, as I look at the strengths, weaknesses, executive management, competitive landscape, and the core strategies of all the companies in the technology landscape, that Apple is among the few I am certain will still be relevant and in the game 10 years from now and for much longer.</p>
<h4>Others Going Vertical</h4>
<p>A question I look at as I analyze specific companies is who is building a strategy to be a long term company. Many tech companies develop strategies and create corporate vision in the 3-5 year range. Many also don’t even go that far as they are only planning 1-2 years out. There are a rare few companies who strategize a bit longer and Apple is one of them.</p>
<p>Yet if you look at some of the core strategies of those who I think are thinking longer term, you will note that they are headed down a vertically oriented path—just as Apple is. Microsoft will inevitably get into more hardware business, Lenovo has their own smartphone OS in China, Samsung will invest in its own middleware solution and Google owns a smartphone and tablet hardware company.</p>
<p>Companies today are faced with the reality that a hardware only business model is not sustainable. That business model always results in a ruthless race to the bottom. Companies who can add unique value at the software and services level can protect their hardware efforts. In mature markets the vertical model is the most sustainable and defendable model there is. So it is easy to see why others are on the verge of going fully vertical the same way Apple has been for decades. Which brings up an interesting point and it gets to the question of my columns title.</p>
<p>Almost every major company who is thinking long term is headed in a vertical direction. This is a model that Apple has used since the beginning. To put it another way, <span class="pullquote">Apple has decades of experience executing the very model that many companies are hanging their future on</span>. This does not mean that others will be successful implementing a vertical model, only that they believe it is the way forward.</p>
<p>There is a massive land grab and Apple does not need to own as much land (market share) as others in order to have an incredibly large and profitable business. If Apple simply acquired and maintained 10% of the global smartphone market (when it is saturated) they would ship five times as many iPhones as they currently do. I believe Apple will get and maintain a larger piece of the global pie for smartphones and tablets but I use that number to make a point.</p>
<p>I recognize that investors have a distorted and mostly short term view of the world. So I can’t fault them for being short sighted. But I would encourage them to dig deep down and ask themselves what tech company is more heathy than Apple and better positioned for success in the long run? If Apple isn&#8217;t still on the forefront of innovation then who is?</p>
<p>At the launch of the first iPhone, Steve Jobs said this:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything”</p></blockquote>
<p>Stop expecting Apple to make every once in a while happen every year.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t hear the topic of transparency brought up nearly enough. I asked the question in my column today of <a href="http://techpinions.com/what-tech-company-is-healthier-than-apple-2/13971">what company is more healthy than Apple</a> and now I ask what company is more transparent than Apple? The cost of being transparent is that inevitably you will expose some dirt.  Most companies want to sweep dirt under the rug.  But as I read the latest <a href="http://www.apple.com/supplierresponsibility/reports.html">supplier responsibility progress report</a> from Apple, it hit me that Apple is not just interested in exposing the dirt but actively trying to clean it up.   </p>
<p>Now I know many tech companies do this but I have to emphasize that it is a very difficult problem and its not one that a company who is in a commodity race to the bottom would have the time or money to truly invest in.  However, this most recent report from Apple released today included something that I thought was extremely interesting.  </p>
<p>Take a look at the following core violations Apple found and the action taken.  </p>
<p><a href="http://techpinions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-24-at-4.04.58-PM.png"><img src="http://techpinions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-24-at-4.04.58-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-01-24 at 4.04.58 PM" width="572" height="459" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13931" /></a></p>
<p>The part that stuck out to me was that Apple terminated business with the supplier.  This is more than just a small detail.  Apple chooses suppliers for very specific reasons largely unique to a product or process.  Often times heavily customized processes are in place at these suppliers for Apple&#8217;s products thus making a relationship with that supplier more like an investment.  For Apple to terminate business with a core supplier could have significant supply chain ramifications.  Replacing that supplier is also not an overnight process but takes time and more equity to get a new supplier up to speed.  </p>
<p>This is interesting to me because if all Apple was interested in was a pure profit motive, they would not have taken an action like this.  </p>
<p>Here was another one I found interesting on the topic of bonded labor or human trafficking.  </p>
<p><a href="http://techpinions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-24-at-4.05.21-PM.png"><img src="http://techpinions.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Screen-Shot-2013-01-24-at-4.05.21-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2013-01-24 at 4.05.21 PM" width="573" height="233" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13934" /></a></p>
<p>Apple actively investigated and worked to resolve accounts of forced (slave) labor in factories that make their products.  Again what does this say about Apple and their philosophy as a company? Are these moves a profit at all costs kind of action? </p>
<p>These kinds of things impact change of a positive nature.  I know from many sources I speak with in the supply chain that getting a deal with Apple can literally change the fortunes of many overnight. Actions like this will hopefully help those companies bidding for Apple&#8217;s business in future product follow ethical principles in their business practices if they want a chance at Apple&#8217;s lucrative business.  </p>
<p>Fascinating stuff and very encouraging. Obviously global supply chains are hard to manage and often filled with dark secrets most care to keep in the closet.  We can only hope that continued work like this and greater corporate transparency becomes common practice throughout the industry.  </p>

<h4>Mac</h4>
<p>Apple sold 4.1 million Macs compared to 5.2 million in the year ago quarter. That&#8217;s a decline of 16% on a week to week basis. My initial reaction to this news was that Macs were suffering from the same malaise that is plaguing all notebook and desktop computers. I&#8217;m sure that this is somewhat true, but Apple laid the blame squarely on supply constraints. In other words, they couldn&#8217;t make their Macs fast enough to meet demand.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;we were significantly constrained with respect to the new iMacs and we&#8217;re only able to ship them for the final month of the December quarter. We believe our Mac sales would have been much higher absent those constraints. ~ Peter Oppenheimer</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, it does not appear that Apple is confident that they will be able to make enough Macs for the upcoming quarter either.</p>
<blockquote><p>On iMac we&#8217;re confident that we&#8217;re going to significantly increase the supply, but the demand tier is very strong and we&#8217;re not certain that we will achieve a supply/demand balance during the quarter. Peter Oppenheimer</p></blockquote>
<h4>iPad</h4>
<p>Apple sold 22.9 iPads compared to 15.4 million in the year ago quarter. That is an increase of 60% on a week to week basis.</p>
<p>Clearly the iPad Mini was a big seller, although Apple didn&#8217;t break out the specific numbers. Again, Apple couldn&#8217;t make enough iPad Mini&#8217;s to satisfy demand and they&#8217;re still struggling to make enough, even now.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the iPad mini was very constrained.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We believe that we can achieve supply-demand balance on iPad mini later this quarter.</p></blockquote>
<p>One interesting note is that the popularity of the lower priced iPad Mini brought the average sales price (ASP) of all iPads down by $101 on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<h4>iPhone</h4>
<p>Apple sold 47.8 million iPhones compared to 37 million in the year ago quarter. That&#8217;s an increase of 39% on a week to week basis.</p>
<p>Again, for much of the quarter, Apple simply couldn&#8217;t make enough iPhone 5&#8242;s to satisfy demand. More surprisingly, Apple was unable to make enough iPhone 4&#8242;s to satisfy demand and they are still struggling to do so.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you look at the iPhone sales across the quarter, we were very constrained for much of the quarter on iPhone 5.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>iPhone 4 was actually in constraint for the entire quarter&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;supply of iPhone 5 was short to demand until late in the quarter and iPhone 4 was short for the entire quarter.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>We believe that we can achieve supply/demand balance &#8230; on iPhone 4 during this quarter.</p></blockquote>
<p>This information, along with reports from Verizon, would seem to suggest iPhone 4 sales were growing in caparison with the iPhone 5. However, we have two statements in the earnings call that seem to counter this conclusion.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the ASP for iPhone was essentially the same year-over-year in the quarter that we just finished.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the mix of iPhones was drifting towards the older models, one would expect the average sales price to go down, not remain the same.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;if you looked at the mix of iPhone 5 to total iPhone and then in the previous year you look at 4S to total iPhones towards the top iPhone those mixes are similar.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s about as plain as it gets (although I still wish it were plainer).</p>
<h4>iOS</h4>
<p>All told, Apple sold over 75 million new iOS devices this quarter bringing their total to over half a billion. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/23/apple-international-sales/">Kantar estimates</a> that Apple gained 6.3% market share in the U.S. and maintained market share in Europe with growth of only 0.2%</p>
<h4>Revenue, Income &#038; Cash</h4>
<p>Apple&#8217;s revenue for the quarter was 54.5 billion compared to 46.3 billion in the year ago quarter. That&#8217;s an increase on a week to week basis of 27%. To put that into <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/23/long-aapl/">perspective</a>:</p>
<p>&#8211; Apple generated more revenue in one quarter than Google did in all of 2012.<br />
&#8211; Apple is getting close to generating as much revenue in one quarter as Microsoft does in one year.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s net income (profit) was 13.1 billion. That&#8217;s an increase on a week to week basis of 8%. To put that into perspective:</p>
<p>&#8211; Apple made over a billion dollars in profit a week.<br />
&#8211; Apple made more in profit (13.1 billion) than <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/01/22/googles-q4-revenue-up-39-percent-net-income-up-14-percent/">Google made in revenue</a> (11.34 billion). Further, Apple generated as much profit in three weeks as <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/01/22/googles-q4-revenue-up-39-percent-net-income-up-14-percent/">Google did in three months</a> ($2.89 billion).<br />
&#8211; Apple&#8217;s 13.1 billion in earnings this quarter was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_corporate_profits_and_losses">fourth largest of all time</a>.</p>
<p>Apple&#8217;s cash totaled $137 billion compared to $121 billion at the end of the September quarter. That&#8217;s a sequential increase of almost $16 billion.</p>
<h4>The Future Of Computing In Two Parts</h4>
<p>I have a pet theory that mobile computing is breaking into a premium iOS operating system and a commodity Android operating system. Please pardon the following very long quotes from Apple&#8217;s earning call, but it appears that Apple is thinking along the same lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>While other mobile devices and operating systems faced increasing security risks and fragmented inconsistent user experiences iPhone and iOS continue to deliver an exceptional experience that people love. They also provide a secure and trusted ecosystem that IT departments require. iPhone continues to be embraced by government agencies and businesses across the globe.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Many U.S. government agencies are issuing iPhones by the thousands as part of their new mobile strategies. Some examples include NASA and National Oceanic Atmospheric Association, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Transportation Security Administration.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also seeing continued growth iPhone growth in business across the board from companies replacing existing smartphone deployments to businesses adding first-time smartphone users. Companies around the world like Neiman Marcus, Skanska and Volvo are issuing iPhone to their employees to improve interactions with customers and give workers access to essential corporate data.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In addition to the tremendous response from consumers, iPad continues to be the tablet of choice for businesses and government agencies, transforming the way their employees work. Financial institutions like Barclays, Nomura Securities, and Bank of Beijing are deploying iPad to enable employees to better service customers and work securely with financial portfolios and products. In particular, Barclays&#8217; rollout of over 8,000 iPads has generated tremendous employee engagement and feedback, making it the most successful IT deployment in Barclays&#8217; history.</p>
<p>State and local governments in the United States are also rapidly adopting iPad. Court systems, accounting inspectors, and law enforcement agencies use iPad to streamline processes and replace huge amounts of paper. And state legislatures in Virginia, Texas, and West Virginia are all using the iPad to give lawmakers instant access to government documents and information.</p>
<p>Outside the U.S., 10,000 iPads are being deployed as part of broad adoption of the local government workflow solution in Sweden and over 5,000 iPads have been purchased by the government in the Netherlands for the Dutch tax authority and the Dutch court system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note the adoption of iOS devices in business, government and education. These were areas where Microsoft ruled supreme but now their dominance seems to be waning. And these are areas where Android is struggling despite its massive mobile market share.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Apple is engaged in a battle for control over the future of personal computing. Microsoft and Intel won the last battle but, in terms of unit sales and potential profits, that battle seems almost trivial. While Microsoft and Intel controlled the desktop and notebook markets, it appears that the combination of the smartphones and tablets is going to eclipse the PC&#8217;s numbers and profits by far.</p>
<p>There are many companies vying to become the king of personal computing. Each company has its strengths and each has its weaknesses. Apple has the hardware and software in place, but the future of computing is the cloud acting as the digital hub for all of that hardware and software and Apple has not yet proven its competency in that realm. Google has the most popular mobile operating system in the world but they haven&#8217;t figured out how to monetize it&#8230;yet. Microsoft is the king of the notebook and the desktop but that market is diminishing and Microsoft can&#8217;t seem to get any traction in mobile (smartphones and tablets). Samsung is making money &#8211; though not as much money as Apple &#8211; but they are not in control of their operating system or their ecosystem. Amazon? Geez, how does one evaluate Amazon? The less profit they make the more successful people think they become.</p>
<p>Tech is involved in its own personal game of thrones. And there are many new contestants waiting for their chance to steal the crown. It&#8217;s difficult to predict the future of personal computing but it&#8217;s easy to see that it&#8217;s going to be fascinating to watch.</p>

<p>Near the end the dot-com bubble, smart investors finally realized that a major problem with tech stock pricing was that dozens of companies were priced to perfection: Their stock prices were so high relative to the underlying financials that only a perfect performance could justify the share price for any length of time. Very few companies could deliver perfection and the house of cards folded.</p>
<p>Apple these days seems to be the opposite of a bubble dot-com. Despite a depressed stock price&#8211;it was trading at a very mediocre 11.6 times trailing earnings before accounting for a sharp after-hours post-earnings plunge. Apple has now given up all the gains of the past year,</p>
<p>And while I am no financial analyst, this is ridiculous. The sharp run-up in the stock that ended abruptly this fall was fully justified by the company&#8217;s stellar performance and even at its peak, Apple was still underpriced by most fundamental metrics. Two things have been true about Apple&#8217;s performance for some time: Its margins and growth rate were both unsustainable. But in a reasonable world, there was room for both to decline, as they have, and for shares to keep rising, as they most certainly haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Apple has always been a stock that traded heavily on emotion rather than analysis and now is no different. If pessimists want to drive it lower, they mill, despite a P/E heading for single digits and a price that&#8217;s just a bit more than three times the cash on hand.</p>
<p>Disclosure: I do not have any direct position in AAPL stock, though funds I invest in may.</p>
