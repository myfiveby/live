<p>For this inaugural season, reminds me of the time of another embattled President. A President who had similarly won a landslide for a second term. Abraham Lincoln. The Great Abe and his visionary quest for justice. A mission he led the nation, by sacrificing all he had. His sacrifice? The meagre life and blood he had. Don&#8217;t mistake my words here: Meagre by his standards &#8211; GREAT by ours.</p>
<p>A man so reviled in his time, he fell sick and even after he won &#8211; was assassinated. And yet so praised today. A man teaching me, that the slander heaped upon us &#8212; today&#8217;s leaders &#8212; seems to be so much confetti, when compared to his burden. Yes, that&#8217;s the burden of leadership&#8230; You LEAD and you leave people so far behind, they can only throw stones at your back in an effort to slow you down.</p>
<p>Washington DC of all places, is where I saw the LINCOLN film and was taken aback. As a matter of fact I remain stunned by the revelations to this moment when writing this piece. Of course &#8211; to put it in context &#8211; it was around the time of the Presidential Inauguration of a great friend, President Obama &#8212; and one cannot remain unmoved. But I never write movie critiques and this sin is not one of my choosing. So this isn&#8217;t one either. Just the tangent of the film allows me some reflection on Lincoln&#8217;s type of Leadership and his Innovations in both the Politics of the world, but perhaps more importantly, in the elevation of our collective and all too human, selfish wants &#8212; into wisdom.</p>
<p>Lincoln&#8217;s Innovations go to the heart of the Polity: His innovation is today self evident in the conduct of our affairs and mental capacity to rule and be ruled by our betters. Regardless of creed, religion, colour of skin or ideology. To be governed democratically in a fashion all too emergent &#8211; even today &#8211; in his time and in our time. To be better as &#8220;Citizens&#8221; rather than as sheeple led by demagogues. To have, to hold, and live in a Democracy with respect for the minorities amongst us &#8212; and to elevate our vision beyond the horizon.</p>
<p>That is Lincoln&#8217;s greatest gift to our today. And this movie is such a realistic performance that Daniel Day-Lewis will surely take home this year&#8217;s Academy Awards as best Actor. But the real Oscar belongs to Lincoln. The President whose movie will be renamed for me, as the 13th Amendment&#8230; forever. The bloody Emancipation of a people steeped in history&#8217;s destiny and bleeding the moment.</p>
<p>In my mind this is the portrayal of President Abraham Lincoln and for that it is remarkable. And while Steven Spielberg&#8217;s film is set during the American Civil War &#8212; the focus on Lincoln&#8217;s political campaign to abolish slavery, the political will to succeed on his divine mission at any cost and the subtext about today&#8217; difficult Presidential choices &#8211; are all genius.</p>
<p>The film script and enlightened acting focuses on the Man&#8217;s relationships and life&#8217;s transactions with family, personal and professional difficulties, depression, fate, indecision, death of children, wife&#8217;s tempestuous nature, war &amp; peace, his strong cabinet, the errant Congress and erstwhile Senate, the mosaic of American people, his own constituency, his conflicted morality, his private and public principles, his beliefs, and the ideology of the Constitution of America&#8217;s vaunted democratic equality  &#8211; and yet, he never fails to reason. And always connects with today&#8217;s difficult decisions of an embattled President who is the embodiment of the struggle that President Lincoln won for all of us&#8230;</p>
<p>Because he won the war. He won the gravest battles of them all: The battle to judge a man by the content of his character and the merit of his actions and not by the colour of his skin. The battle to honour a man because of the measure of his humanity and not the thickness of his skin. The battle to make our skin impervious to the insults of racism&#8230;</p>
<p>President Lincoln made this possible and President Obama now lives both the dream and the gauntlet that the &#8220;tall guy&#8221;  prepared for him a hundred and fifty years ago in his bid to line the road for a more perfect union&#8230;</p>
<p>The legacy of Abraham Lincoln hangs over every American President &#8211; but never before as much as today. Because President Obama is both the beneficiary as well as the test tube baby of this ancient rule Lincoln wrote and grafted into the skin of American Democracy.</p>
<p>The legacy of Lincoln is not made up of his historical achievements that we all know about. It&#8217;s not really all about his resolute principle to fight and prosecute winningly the bloodiest of internal conflicts &#8211; a civil war to free his people, to preserve the Union, and then to go on bind up the nation’s wounds&#8230;</p>
<p>All that&#8217;s Great, but the real Lincoln’s as President at a moment of great moral passion in his country’s history, is a political Innovator. A deeply flawed human that arose above his station in life and emerged as the Leader of our TOMORROWS&#8230; Because real leadership demands a measure of sacrifice of our today so that we can leap forward the fogs of &#8220;war&#8221; in order to build a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>And who better Man to teach us this strategic political innovation than President Abraham Lincoln. He whom a long with countless many young men in uniform sacrificed all their tomorrows for our better today. He himself &#8211; all too knowingly &#8212; made the ultimate sacrifice to build a better tomorrow. For &#8212; never be mistaken &#8212; when you do a great thing people will hate you vehemently&#8230; Because you&#8217;ve shaken their comfort. An illusory comfort in hell &#8212; but that is all of what they know. Like Socrates cave paradox, people are animals &#8212; thinking animals who want to believe in their existence&#8230;</p>
<p>Yet Lincoln knew human nature well. Having gone through the cauldron of fire for the whole of his Life&#8230; He was tested and tested again. Life never gave him quarters to stand still. He was always being tested. And he was pushed along by waves of misery flooding all over him. time ad again. And yet &#8212; he came out of it. He came out like a blade fired, and iced and rolled a thousand times&#8230; He came out sharp, resolute, cutting and strong. Hard and unyielding. Yet flexible enough to bend all the way &#8211; but not break. Swaying here and there and then deciding &#8211; after thoughtfully long deliberation. That was Abe and this is his legacy&#8230;</p>
<p>Let us then study Lincoln&#8217;s long term vision, his brain software grafting capacity, and his high-caliber leadership, because these are the traits we can all use to navigate TODAY and take correct decisions and result in far reaching actions. Actions that will inform our tomorrow&#8217;s with the light of knowing and emergence&#8230;</p>
<p>In this season of Lincoln, Political leaders, Citizens, CEOs, Business Executives, Entrepreneurs and all other mindful leaders might find it useful to be researching the History of the 16th President&#8217;s decisions and impacts, googling his speeches on Youtube, and watching this film along with a visit to your Quora, Wikipedia, or history books to take a closer look at what might be called the Lincoln Leadership Academy.</p>
<p>Seeing this film is a must. And calling the film ‘The Thirteenth Amendment’ or the Emancipation movie, may be more apt for our purposes because there is no denying this is a Political lesson in winning and holding on to the High Moral Ground. And no name appreciation is needed here. He didn&#8217;t do what he did to be remembered. He didn&#8217;t want to be sacrificed but that he knew was his price too. His Oscar moment. That is what his story is and that is what&#8217;s all clear in Leadership terms. Do your bet quietly, secretly, with all your might and knowing that You will be persecuted for this&#8230;</p>
<p>What an oxymoron to our current checks and balances and rewards system built in our business life and political agendas.</p>
<div>
<p>Abe’s fight to get a Constitutional Amendment to change the law and abolish slavery in 1865 – in the dying embers of the American Civil War is what the essence holds here. And the message for me and for President Obama is clear. The gauntlet for this President of today is to abolish another SLAVERY. A modern version of the old shame&#8230;</p>
<p>We must abolish economic slavery. We must abolish abject Poverty. We must abolish Famine. We must abolish the quiet cold stare of disrespect, the stone cold hatred of those unable to feed themselves, and replace all that with the respect of humanity. For we are all created EQUAL&#8230;</p>
<p>Economic Slavery today for the many millions of Americans struggling bellow the subsistence line is what am talking about. Am not just talking poverty here&#8230; Am talking the disgraceful poverty of not having enough to eat in the richest nation this Earth has ever seen. That&#8217;s what am talking about here&#8230;.</p>
<p>Hear me Mr President:  I&#8217;ve seen the people going hungry from Mississippi and Alabama all the way to Washington DC. And from  California and Washington state all the way to New York and Massachusetts&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen Abject Poverty. You don&#8217;t have to travel far&#8230; A mile or so south from the White House and you are in the midst of despair. Poverty so bleak your eyes water. Poverty without hope. Poverty without recourse. Poverty of epidemic proportions. Poverty so desperate that it has caused an AIDS epidemic. That&#8217;s what am talking about&#8230;</p>
<p>The abject poverty of slavery is no different that this and it&#8217; a shame for our humanity.</p>
<p>Because the mere existence of this levels of poverty and spiritual slavery only shows our own poverty.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why people hate me when I say this:</p>
<p>Because I exhibit rationally, the Poverty of our Consciousness.</p>
<p>The Poverty of our Will.</p>
<p>The poverty of our Compassion.</p>
<p>The dismal poverty of our Humanity.</p>
<p>POVERTY</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what bankrupting our nations..</p>
<p>And while this Poverty debate might lead to intriguing political fare &#8211; Abraham Lincoln’s story is a struggle against POVERTY too. Because after the recent death of his son Willie (the second out of four sons he lost to illness, Lincoln springs in to action. And how often does this remind me of the many millions of Americans who cannot afford the most rudimentary of health care? How many times don&#8217;t we hear of families going into catastrophe, losing their homes and becoming destitute and homeless when they are faced with catastrophic illness and it is the time they need their stability the most?  How many times don&#8217;t we hear and see families who lost their caregiver and were thrown out of the social fabric because of the death of the primary breadwinner, due to an easily curable disease had it been diagnosed early and medically acted upon?  Where in God&#8217;s name then is the social fiber holding us all together in this great nation under God? Where is Justice, Social Security and American exceptionalism ,when we spend more mindshare on fighting progress than in taking care of our brethren?</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where Lincoln becomes relevant today. Because a fiercely determined President appears to battle the evils of his day &#8212; keeping in mind the future and the eye on the prize. Changing people&#8217;s perceptions of reality. Lincoln battled slavery in the way that the bondage of poverty represented slavery then and it still represents now.</p>
<p>Because keeping a man poor and bonded in your service is what slavery is all about. And that was the wealth of the South. The cotton crop cultivation, the cotton ginning and milling and the cotton clubbing fortunes were built upon. blood money.. Same as the money earned by some of the richest people on earth &#8211; like the WalMart family &#8211; dependent on the million of lowest paid poor people working at Wal-Mart&#8217;s slavery wages and unable to make ends meet. The American people want this shame to change. But corporate America is fearing change. They say they fear the loss of productivity when the opposite is true. The better paid workers work better. productivity increase every time we have even the tiniest of incremental raises of compensation. And in the opposite case, the out of work masses and especially those even out of the minimum wage work poor who are lost in the debate &#8212; there is no future.</p>
<p>Keep in mind; Leaders of all sorts must understand that lack of a social &#8220;floor,&#8221; lack of hope and no prospect for future prosperity through gainful employment, is not just a form of slavery &#8212; it is SLAVERY capitalized. And the wealth generated on their backs is bloody wealth and a curse to society as a whole. Same as the cotton wealth assigned the South into a pattern of underdevelopment that persists today, this form of slavery assigns the whole of these United States in a form of colonial underdevelopment today and perhaps tomorrow too &#8212; if we don&#8217;t change course drastically.</p>
<p>YES, these actions of corporate America represent SLAVERY. The people they resign to hopelessness constitute today&#8217;s slaves. The slaves that we all collectively sold them a pack of lies. A bill of nought. An empty promise. The ones we sold to, the emptiness of the America dream like so much free cable TV&#8230; Those are the Slaves of today begging to be emancipated. But who amongst the leaders is listening?</p>
</div>
<p>Yes &#8211; America is at a crossroads all over again: A different kind of slavery has taken hold. The idea that poverty represents another form of slavery is not my innovation. I stole this line form another man. A great Man before my time. This line belongs to Martin Luther King. A King indeed. King of the people who willfully gave up his life to preach CHANGE and JUSTICE. And yes, it was his idea&#8230; yet I truly believe it.</p>
<p>More so today than ever before.</p>
<p>And as President Obama said in his inaugural address last week, America “cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.”</p>
<p>Yet that continues to be the direction we’re heading in.</p>
<p>A newly-released analysis by the Economic Policy Institute shows that the super-rich have done well in the economic recovery while almost everyone else has done badly. The top 1 percent of earners’ real wages grew 8.2 percent from 2009 to 2011, yet the real annual wages of Americans in the bottom 90 percent have continued to decline in the recovery, eroding by 1.2 percent between 2009 and 2011.</p>
<p>In other words, we’re back to the widening inequality we had before the debt bubble burst in 2008 and the economy crashed. We are actually approaching the time of economic inequality the Southern States enjoyed between landowners and slaves at the time when the Confederacy seceded from the Union&#8230;  Not Good News for our Union today. Nor is it good news for the state of the world either &#8212; because America signals leadership everywhere&#8230;</p>
<p>President Obama spoke against it repeatedly and he is exactly right. Not even the very wealthy can continue to succeed without a broader-based prosperity. That’s because 70 percent of economic activity in America is consumer spending. If the bottom 90 percent of Americans are becoming poorer, they’re less able to spend. Without their spending, the economy can’t get out of first gear&#8230; and the desperately poor cannot hope to find work and thus get out of the vicious cycle of poverty and dependency&#8230;</p>
<p>And the vicious cycle am talking about is the biggest reason why the recovery continues to be anemic, and why the International Monetary Fund has just lowered its estimate for US growth in 2013 to just two percent. Bellow 2% as a matter of fact&#8230;</p>
<p>And thus almost a quarter of all jobs in America now pay wages below the poverty line for a family of four. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates 7 out of 10 growth occupations over the next decade will be low wage — like working at big box Wal-Mart type retailers, manning service stations, and serving at fast-food chains.</p>
<p>And at this rate, the millions of new poor every year are unable to meet their basic needs. So the question asked of the Corporate leaders should be: Who’s going to buy all the goods and services America is producing? We can’t return to the kind of debt-financed consumption that caused the bubble in the first place. And the rest of the world isn&#8217;t doing any better to absorb the American production surplus&#8230;</p>
<p>So who is gonna buy all those Ipads and Iphoness and Imacs and all selfish status symbols our contemporarie cannot live without?</p>
<p>Do you get the seriousness of this?  This is more like a prisoner&#8217;s dilemma than a simple corporate policy game. We all cooperate and we win. We defect towards our own narrowly defined self interest and we all lose&#8230; It’s not a zero-sum game. Wealthy Americans would do better with smaller shares of a rapidly growing economy than with the large shares they now possess of an economy that’s barely moving. This adds economic rational thinking to my argument about the need to abolish the economic SLAVERY of today: POVERTY</p>
<p>If the wealthy Corporate Leaders, the Business Executives, and the leading Americans, were really leading like Lincoln, they would be rational and in a long term vision bound action &#8212; they would support public investments in education and job-training, a world-class infrastructure with advanced transportation, water and sewage, energy, internet, faster wage growth, emancipation from poverty and basic research – all of which would make the American workforce more productive and the American economy far more resilient.</p>
<p>If the Corporate Leaders of today were Lincolnian and rational they’d even support labour unions – which have proven the best means of giving working people a fair share in the nation’s prosperity sharing in the enterprise&#8217;s fortunes and causing a sense of ownership of the future. Remember &#8212; we are all in this together after all&#8230;</p>
<p>Even before “Lincoln” came along, there was a certain light of inspiration from his life&#8217;s achievement and work. But today, as President Obama embarks on a second term of leading the &#8220;office&#8221; and business leaders object to his policies &#8211; especially Wall Street and Finance house CEOs, it&#8217;s important to remember: The struggle to keep pace with a rapidly changing global economy, the challenge of the growing wealth disparity in these United states, and the lessons of Lincoln&#8217;s leadership are all intertwined. Because Lincoln&#8217;s challenges seem as relevant today as ever. They demonstrate the importance of resilience, forbearance, emotional intelligence, thoughtful listening and the consideration of all sides of an argument before arriving to a decision. And they also show the value of a greater Human Vision than simple quarterly profits. The greatness of staying true to a larger mission. The Aspiration to succeed for all of us. Not for one&#8217;s self only&#8230;</p>
<p>Lincoln’s presidency is a big gift to all of us and especially to the US. Mainly because the man always looked up. He looked upwards to the stars and always called on American citizens to choose a higher road. He called all Americans and the world, to a purpose bigger than themselves. He did this by LEADING.</p>
<p>Leading and listening carefully to all sides. Hearing those both inside and outside of his cabinet, his immediate circle and sphere of influence. Listening, always being present authentically, and staking your high moral ground with principle pickets, are all essential leadership qualities whether one is leading a company, a country in wartime or peace time, or even an innovative Start Up during the period of transformation from chrysalis to butterfly.</p>
<p>Life is tough &#8211; Get used to it.</p>
<p>Life is not fair &#8211; Bear it.</p>
<p>Life is your cauldron of fire &#8211; Endure it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s Lincoln for me. Because even before he signed the Emancipation Proclamation, 150 years ago, Lincoln confronted a string of military setbacks, intense political opposition and his own depression and self-doubts. In the summer of 1862, the slave owning Southern forces &#8211; under master general Robert E. Lee &#8211; attacked repeatedly, relentlessly, and with a courage bordering on recklessness, the Union cities and supporters. They attacked so hard that the North realized that the Civil War — originally envisioned as a short, swift conflict — would be much longer, bloodier, and far more difficult than ever imagined. And that was the death warrant of Lincoln&#8230;</p>
<p>Northern newspapers and politicians assailed Lincoln&#8217;s administration for incompetence. The number of Union Army volunteers dwindled and desertions skyrocketed.  The fancy abolitionists who since the war’s start had urged Lincoln to move aggressively against slavery, grew increasingly frustrated and went quiet in the face of public rancor.</p>
<p>All of this bore down on the President and threw him into depression. When he learned that George B. McClellan, commander of the Army of the Potomac, had retreated after a series of conflicts known as the Seven Days’ Battles, Lincoln described himself “as nearly inconsolable as I could be and live.” And, personally, the death of his 11-year-old son, Willie, five months earlier still weighed heavily on both the president and his wife.</p>
<p>Yet despite all of his mental suffering, Lincoln never gave way to his darkest fears. His resilience and commitment to preserve the Union helped sustain him.</p>
<p>The ability to experience negative emotions without falling through the floorboards is vital to Political leaders as Churchill said and to entrepreneurs and business leaders. Strategic Leaders have to lean to the wind throughout their days. Entrepreneurs must maintain their professional composure while staying true to their goals, vision and their integrity &#8211; in order to first gain wisdom and then &#8211; maybe &#8211; only maybe, succeed in the marketplace of ideas and great products.</p>
<p>Lincoln is striking because he did all this under extremely difficult circumstances. His ability to navigate such difficult terrain was about emotional intelligence and the deep faith he nurtured about his vision. But some of it was also about how he gathered advice and information from a wide range of people, including those who did not agree with him. This is important in building a business because you have to listen to customers, employees, suppliers and investors, including those who are critical of what you are doing.</p>
<p>Lincoln had long opposed the expansion of slavery, declaring it wrong, morally and politically, because it violated the rights of all people to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness set forth in the Declaration of Independence. But he had also made it clear that preserving the Union was more important than trying to abolish slavery immediately thus proving his pragmatic nature and mature political will&#8230;</p>
<p>Yet in the early summer of 1862, events conspired to change his perspective. There was Union general McClellan’s humiliating retreat, the mounting overall toll of the war, the incredible never yet seen to that day, bloodshed &#8212; and the rowing support in the North for attacking slavery. His earlier concerns were overridden by political expediency, rational exigency, and simple Realpolitik.</p>
<p>&#8220;Things had gone on from bad to worse,” Lincoln recalled later, “until I felt that we had reached the end of our rope on the plan of operations we had been pursuing; that we had about played our last card, and must change our tactics, or lose the game!”</p>
<p>Lincoln’s ability to shift gears during hard times — without giving up his ultimate goal — is a vital lesson for leaders operating in today’s turbulence. When I teach Start Up Innovation and Business Leadership, many times, I explain to executives the need to pivot. Because this is the lincoln lesson of the importance of shaping one’s tactics to changing circumstances and thus pivoting and being flexible enough to allow for a changing landscape resulting from a changed world view.</p>
<p>Sometime in late June or early July of 1862, Lincoln began drafting what would become the Emancipation Proclamation. On July 22, he told his full cabinet that he had “resolved upon this step, and had not called them together to ask their advice,” but rather “to lay the subject matter of a proclamation before them.” He had decided that, as of Jan. 1, 1863, all people held as slaves in states in rebellion against the United States government would be declared forever free.</p>
<p>Lincoln had always been a slow, deliberate thinker, examining an issue from all sides. The cabinet was divided over the proclamation, but at this point he was unlikely to be dissuaded. Nevertheless, when Secretary of State William H. Seward suggested that the president wait for a Union victory before issuing the proclamation, lest it seem “the last measure of an exhausted government, a cry for help,” Lincoln agreed.</p>
<p>In mid-September 1862, after a bloody victory at Antietam in which more than 20,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed or wounded, Lincoln made the Emancipation Proclamation public. Practically, it would free none of the almost four million slaves held in the Confederacy, where it could not be enforced; it made no claims to liberate slaves held in the border states that were not in rebellion against the United States. And it did not free slaves held in certain parts of the Confederacy occupied by Union forces.</p>
<p>But as Lincoln understood, the proclamation was a radical act. In declaring certain slaves free as an act of military necessity, it transformed the meaning and stakes of the Civil War. What started as a conflict to save the Union as it had existed since the 1787 Constitutional Convention had become a contest to save a new, different kind of United States — one in which slavery was permanently abolished.</p>
<p>Americans reacted strongly to the proclamation. Abolitionists greeted it with acclaim, but many in Lincoln’s own party called it unconstitutional. Union Democrats condemned it; the Democratic-leaning New York World said Lincoln was “adrift on a current of radical fanaticism.”</p>
<p>In the South, President Jefferson Davis of the Confederacy called the proclamation an effort to incite servile insurrection, saying it supplied additional reasons for the Confederacy to fight for its independence. Foreign response was also critical, partly because the proclamation posed a potential threat to cotton supplies. That November, the effects of the Emancipation Proclamation, the war’s huge casualties and the government’s deteriorating military fortunes combined to hand the president’s party major reverses in the midterm elections.</p>
<p>Faced with these and other setbacks, Lincoln grew more depressed, but his commitment to the proclamation did not waver. When he signed the final document into law, he knew he was altering a landscape that had become much larger than when he became president. And he realized that he must communicate his own steadfast commitment to a larger purpose.</p>
<p>Throughout the war, Lincoln was able to experience a range of emotions without acting on them rashly or in other ways that compromised his larger mission. This ability offers another powerful lesson for modern leaders.</p>
<p>Consider Lincoln’s emotional state after the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863: Lee’s retreating forces had escaped south into Virginia and out of the Union Army’s reach. Lincoln was frustrated and furious. He composed an angry letter to Gen. George C. Meade, who had commanded the Union forces at Gettysburg, writing him that Lee “was within your easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other late successes, have ended the war.” He added: “Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it.”</p>
<p>But Lincoln decided not to mail the letter. Instead, he placed it in an envelope labeled “To Gen. Meade, never sent or signed.” There is no question that Lincoln had cause to lament the general’s inaction, especially in the larger context of the president’s early experience with Union Army officials, but he recognized that he couldn’t afford to alienate him at such a crucial time. He practised forbearance and kept his own counsel quietly</p>
<p>In November 1863, at the cemetery in Gettysburg, Lincoln spoke briefly and outlined the important moment in which America found itself and which he had helped create. In 272 words, he laid out the stakes of the Civil War, asserting that its bloody toll was necessary in order that “government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.” Here is his speech:</p>
<p>When I discuss the Gettysburg Address with executives and entrepreneurs, they often tear up and weep quietly. It is moving but it touches them on so many levels one cannot begin to describe&#8230;</p>
<p>Lincoln often traveled to battlefields to visit Union troops, and he held open “office” hours in the White House to receive interested citizens — and their countless requests. Like Lincoln, Today he is credited with leading a very successful political and military turnaround and remaining magnanimous towards the losers. Forbearing in defeat and magnanimous in victory is how Lincoln governed. He ruled the people steadfastedly by turning a nasty situation of a hopeless war to the victory of winning the UNION. Because he was willing to forgo the satisfaction and gratification of victory &#8211; the Union was saved. People forget that preserving the Union was always Mr Lincoln&#8217;s priority&#8230; It was never just about winning the war. The urgent matter at hand must not distract us from the long term vision and the goal we set to achieve. That&#8217;s what leadership is all about.</p>
<p>In my class, executives often point to the strength that Lincoln found to bear the death and destruction of the war and to weather intense opposition and still not relinquish his mission. If there is one point when Lincoln discovered his own leadership backbone, it was surely in conceiving and issuing the Emancipation Proclamation and then committing himself and the country to its broader consequences.</p>
<p>And as am traveling and teaching across America, Often hear their dismissal when I discuss my Lincoln leadership lessons with executives. Their refusal to put the parallel of slavery of today&#8217;s poverty to the slavery that Lincoln addressed through his emancipation proclamation in their minds, is one of the most powerful lessons they need to take away. Being responsible for a country and all the people and issues involved forces you to come to terms with yourself and rise to the challenge, not once but many times. Lincoln, was able to do this in a way that amazes and inspires me today &#8212; having seen the film &#8212; more than ever. Yet my students not so much&#8230; Maybe becoming an executive assigns certain values in one&#8217;s mind that place a disconnect to the heart and the real brain. Or maybe it&#8217;s the poverty of ideology and the poverty of compassion and the poverty of humanity we all suffer from&#8230;</p>
<p>Some day they will surely get it like the famous general Lee&#8230; Because when finally at Appomattox, Va., general Lee of the Confederacy surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant, head of the Union forces &#8211; the game was up and the date was April 9th 1865. many years of war and bloodshed were required to accept reality: All men are created equal.</p>
<p>The South finally got it, the North abolished SLAVERY, the Union was preserved and President Lincoln&#8217;s fate was sealed. Still after so much bloodshed, venomous Hate ruled the day. One more sacrifice was needed to seal the deal of history&#8230; The blood of the innocent.</p>
<p>Six short days later, Lincoln was assassinated. And the Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect two years earlier, would become part of a broader process of emancipation that culminated in ratification of the 13th Amendment in December 1865.</p>
<p>Lincoln ruled from the grave&#8230;</p>
<p>His vision was so strong that long past his day on earth, the United states Congress and senate passed the resolution to ratify the Amendment to the Constitution.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s LEADERSHIP.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Pano</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Lincoln, taught us that whether you are a business leader, an entrepreneur or a government official, one’s foremost responsibility is to serve all of the people, and not just one’s self-interest. Lincoln knew that success, like good wine and great food are best when shared.</p>
<p>Lincoln was able to learn and grow amid great calamity. His story, like no other, demonstrates that leaders do not just make the moment; they meet it and, in the process, are changed by it.</p>

<p>But this time the New York leg of my journey has been rather profitable. The administration of New York state has agreed to implement the learnings from England&#8217;s Green Bank creation, and to engage in a bit of the same enlightened action. Well Done&#8230;</p>
<p>A Cool Green Bank Start Up.</p>
<p>A great project.</p>
<p>After years of hard work, lobby and policy papers we are happy to report that Governor Cuomo of New York on his New York State address this January issued his well thought out proposal for the creation of a Green Bank in New York. This of course is for the legislative session ahead to consider and implement.  All the same the fact that the Governor of the great state of New York, in his State of the State message stated his intent to create a $1 billion New York State Green Bank &#8220;to leverage public dollars with a private-sector match to spur the clean economy for the state of New York&#8221; speaks volumes for Green Capital.</p>
<p>The Environmental Parliament and Green Capital salutes and accepts this as the birth of the Green economy for New York and the nation. An important step going forward. Many years of hard work, countless meetings, zillions of proposals and diligent lobby have now come to fruition&#8230;</p>
<p>Grateful</p>
<p>Now on to the use of Green Bonds to augment the capital base of the Bank and finance viability for all New Clean Energies deployed in New York State..</p>
<p>The Governor&#8217;s message states that &#8220;a NY Green Bank offers a cost-effective market mechanism to capitalize on this opportunity, unleashing green technologies and the many benefits that will come with them.&#8221;  It also states that &#8220;the NY Green Bank would overcome a number of obstacles and uncertainties in the clean energy sector, including unstable federal funding and policy, uncoordinated action and disparate one-time subsidies at the state level, a lack of appropriate financial instruments.  The lowering of other barriers would enable clean energy markets to function more fluidly, connecting green projects with investors and capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo&#8217;s leadership in energy policy finance and innovation and this makes total sense here in the state of the Union that has the deepest and greatest financial markets the world over&#8230; Initially the banks and the banksters financing mountain top removal for coal, coal companies and the dirty coal factories, along with all the criminal Tar Sands financiers &#8211; hated this idea of mine, but now Wall Street has seen the light of day and love this. Because it brings money into the economy, it creates good jobs and transactions in their sector, and at the end of day makes good sense overall for value investment, long term capital support, risk mitigation and increased credit worthiness of the State and Country, by building resilience into the system. All Good.</p>
<p>New York has now joined the State of Connecticut in setting up the nation&#8217;s first green banks and the Coalition for Green Capital will be working this year in many other states to set up these banks under the helpful leadership of Reed Hundt &#8211; ex FCC chair and enlightened Co-operator.</p>
<p>It is proven that Green bank financing substantially lowers the cost of clean energy and moves us towards the goal of producing clean energy at levels lower than the price of existing dirty sources of energy.  The fact that the green banks provide loans that will be repaid, and are not grants and giveaways is a great plus a the capital will course throughout the economy creating a virtuous cycle. And as Governor Cuomo&#8217;s said &#8212; green banks will take the burden of funding off of the taxpayers, and the green banks will provide many green jobs, bringing long-term benefits to society and the environment by contributing to the mitigation of climate change.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how you built the Green Economy &#8212; a step at a time&#8230;</p>
<p>And all these &#8220;overnight successes&#8221; are fifteen years in the making &#8212; because this is how long has taken us to bring this brilliant effort to light of day. When I first floated this proposal in Wall Street more than 13 years ago, people thought it was crazy. And guess what they thought of me as well&#8230; Now it seems normal and very much in need. The issue with pioneers is that they get reviled first, renounced, attacked, and eventually embraced and accepted. Not so much the person as the ideas this person brought. Because the person &#8211; the pioneer &#8211; is still this angular edgy always running ahead at a million miles warp speed and can&#8217;t be embraced. But the ideas are cherished when the passage of time has ripened them. That&#8217;s the gift of the Innovators out there for all of society to embrace and enjoy. The Gift of an idea whose time has come&#8230;</p>
<p>Unstoppable.</p>
<p>And the pioneer keeps on giving more hard work pursuing worthy ideas and public service innovation&#8230;  in serious need of the people&#8217;s leadership to embrace.</p>
<p>So it goes for me and New York: Here are a couple more things for the people to consider and press Albany to legislate and the Governor to enact.</p>
<p>Because I believe, that one day soon, not only we will be able to produce enough Clean, Renewable and Green Energy in New York state to alter the emissions profile of this great State and the City that never sleeps, help retire our climate debt, and stop treating our atmosphere like an open sewer &#8212; but also to clean up the air of New York itself, we all breathe.</p>
<p>And to make us all safer by also removing the criminal threat hanging over the people&#8217;s heads in New York and Manhattan like a Damocles sword. Because by building enough renewable energy beaseload we will be able to retire and shutter the threatening and über dangerous Indian Point Nuclear plant. The faulty Nuclear Energy nightmare of a plant &#8211; emitting it&#8217;s nuclear radiation isotopes daily &#8212; situated a mere 25 miles from Manhattan&#8230;</p>
<p>Because the Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant was rated by EP as the most dangerous nuclear plant on earth due to it&#8217;s antiquated design, aged, faulty, &amp; leaking infrastructure, and proximity to a vast population centre. No wonder that the Al Qaeda terrorists and Bin Laden had the Indian Point Nuclear plant as their number one target, when selecting their 9/11 attacks &#8212; but even they thought it was too much of a catastrophe to destroy New York and unleash a new Hiroshima upon the people of America&#8230;</p>
<p>Now after Fukushima&#8217;s nuclear melt down and complete devastation writ large in the surrounding Prefecture of Fukushima &#8212; we all know that our foolish disregard for the dangers of Nuclear Energy is a crime worse than terrorism. Human error, design failures, aging &amp; failing infrastructure, severe storms and acts of nature, earthquakes, and the like, all can be more devastating than the criminal minds of terrorists. Indian Point Nuclear plant is a threat beyond what words can describe and we implore the Governor and the Mayor of New York to close it sooner rather than later&#8230;</p>
<p>Because it&#8217;s time to insure our future against that grave threat. Time to close now the Indian Point Nuclear Energy facility. And we can do this by enlightened leadership and legislative fiat, quickly. Or we can do this slowly by financing enough Green Energy to create an aggregated baseload of power, through the Green Bank and Green bonds finance &#8212; in order to replace the aging nuke&#8217;s perceived necessity.</p>
<p>Distributed power generation = People&#8217;s power&#8230; because it seems to me that with the political will lacking to shut down the aging nuclear plant we have to count on the people doing this.</p>
<p>Lot&#8217;s of work ahead to accomplish this&#8230;</p>
<p>Still remaining hopeful and optimistic that we&#8217;ll do this sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Being in New York has it&#8217;s perks and rewards.</p>
<p>The Big Apple is all about Hard Work and more Hard Work&#8230;</p>
<p>Not complaining &#8212; instead thriving in it.</p>
<p>Go on and thrive yourself and bring new renewable energy projects to bask in the light of the New York Green Bank. Because the NYGB soon to open up it&#8217;s doors and spread goodness to all and sundry&#8230; needs your clean energy projects and expertise to finance the FUTURE</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Pano</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo also announced that former member of the Board of Directors of the Coalition for Green Capital, Richard Kauffman, will join his cabinet as the new Chairman for New York Energy Policy and Finance. One of his first responsibilities will be to develop the Governor’s newly proposed NY Green Bank.   Richard Kauffman&#8217;s extensive work in the US Department of Energy as a senior advisor to Secretary Chu combined with experience in the private sector working for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Good Energy, etc, ensures that New York’s energy programs and the newly christened Green Bank enjoy first rate leadership going ahead.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be there to help going forward and support this great initiative from the leading forward economic and banking State of New York&#8230;</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ll augment the capital of the Bank with the use of Green Bonds to close the financing loop of the Green Economy going forward and building great Green Energies of New York to compete with California&#8230;</p>
<p>Because we are actively building momentum in California for a Green Bank there &#8230; as well.</p>
<p>From Sea to shining Sea&#8230;</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>And this not being a Pub culture, we aim for Literary halls of inequity.</p>
<p>So this time around we hit Hunter Thompson&#8217;s favourite watering hole and imbibed ourselves silly&#8230;</p>
<p>Of course it was all for the Rocket to the Moon cause as the writings of the great man attest from the walls of the smoky joint full of unsavoury characters like so many Jack Kerouaks and Alan Ginsbergs &#8212; beatniks who have lost their road and abandoned the great wilds for the canyons of Manhattan and her glory holes&#8230;</p>
<p>Hunter between take, is telling us from the wall:</p>
<p>&#8220;Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming:</p>
<p>&#8221; Wow! What a Ride! &#8221; &#8220;</p>
<p>Kinda makes you want to drink yourself blind and dive into the sea of inequity&#8230;</p>
<p>Another of Hunter&#8217;s dark gems staring us from the wall for all to see:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all alone, born alone, die alone, and ~~ in spite of true romance magazines ~~ we shall all someday look back on our lives and see that, in spite of our company, we were alone the whole way. I do not say lonely ~~ at least, not all the time ~~ but essentially, and finally, alone. This is what makes your self-respect so important, and I don&#8217;t see how you can respect yourself if you must look in the hearts and minds of others for your happiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Agreed &#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about self respect at the end of a brave fighting day for the sake of our Earth and it&#8217;s people &#8212; I get that and I do that &#8212;  but what did Hunter do that was just so cool?</p>
<p>Drank himself to sleep&#8230;</p>
<p>And never minded the Bollocks.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to you man</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Pano</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>After this night &#8212; leaving New York is like leaving Las Vegas&#8230;</p>
<p>And a last one from Gonzo himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;So we shall let the reader answer this question for himself: who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?<br />
Hunter S. Thompson</p>

<p>What&#8217;s most important? An awesome inauguration and inspiring administration meetings, the many new friends and old colleagues that you leave behind, or the day to day business that Democracy generates?</p>
<p>But waking up in New York gives one the needed cadence to get down to brass knuckles business and distinguish easily the wheat from the chaff&#8230; The really important things from the great memories.</p>
<p>So it is with the New York lenses that I choose what&#8217;s most important. The 400 miles of distance from Washington also help put things in perspective.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll go with the third one. This Democracy rocks when the day after the Inauguration of the New President &#8211; because this Obama is brand spanking new &#8211;  the Supremes come out with a Cool surprise of themselves. It&#8217;s a gift to the people of these United States on the occasion of the new President&#8230;.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a boon to the new Obama and the aspirations of the American people&#8230;</p>
<p>Because the Supreme Court issued a decision that they will not &#8220;hear&#8221; a corporate special interests challenge to a tough new clean air requirement limiting sulfur dioxide emissions&#8230;</p>
<p>The high court on Tuesday refused &#8211; flat out &#8211; to hear an appeal from businesses and industrial interests involving an Environmental Protection Agency regulation setting emission levels of sulfur dioxide, a colorless gas with the smell of rotting eggs. Sulfur dioxide from power plant smokestacks can be carried long distances by wind and weather and has been linked to various illnesses including asthma.</p>
<p>This is a far reaching signal from the Supremes that the EPA is not to be messed with. And that the Clean Air and Clean Water regulations are not to be trifled with&#8230;</p>
<p>Several corporations and industrial associations along with several states said that EPA’s required emission levels are lower than mandated by law to protect public health and should be reversed. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Washington DC,  refused to overturn the EPA’s decision. And now the Supremes delivered the final verdict&#8230;</p>
<p>The justices refused to reconsider that ruling. And having also refused to reverse EPA&#8217;s regs and rulings on CO2 emissions, they are setting the world on notice. We will deal with Climate Change with regulation if need be&#8230;</p>
<p>Climate Justice delivered from up high &#8230; the Supremes.</p>
<p>A great winsome decision. And what goodness it spreads by supporting long standing values that emerged at the height of the Environmental Movement a generation ago in the 1970&#8242;s.</p>
<p>What a good feeling this is&#8230;</p>
<p>In some ways &#8211; for me, this decision from the Supremes &#8211; trumps the Inauguration and the heart warming, democracy affirming, pomp and circumstance of the last few days&#8230;</p>
<p>Well Done ladies and men in black&#8230;</p>
<p>Well Done.</p>
<p>We Salute You</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Pano</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>The Supremes&#8230;</p>
<p>They were all there smiling at the Inauguration having already decided what they will release the next day&#8230;</p>
<p>The Supremes unplugged make great music.</p>
<p>Justice Sotomayor rules&#8230;</p>
<p>Unleashed is more like it.</p>
<p>Major Kudos</p>
<p>Grateful</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>The first stage of the Fukushima Wind farm project will be the construction of a 2-megawatt turbine, a substation and undersea cable installation. The turbine will stand 200 metres high. If successful, further turbines will be built subject to the availability of funding.</p>
<p>To get around the cost of anchoring the turbines to the sea bed, they will be built on buoyant steel frames which will be stabilised with ballast and anchored to the 200-metre-deep continental shelf that surrounds the Japanese coast via mooring lines to the sea bed&#8230;</p>
<p>The Fukushima Wind Master Plan is to build a total of 143 wind turbines on floating platforms 16 kilometres off the coast of Fukushima, by the end of year 2020. Fukushima prefecture is home to the melt down, Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor of Tokyo Electric Power Co. that hit the headlines in March 2011 when it was damaged by an earthquake and inundated by the subsequent tsunami &#8211; and it has been releasing radiation ever since&#8230;</p>
<p>So time for Japan to turn a new leaf. They learned the lesson the hard way. Nuclear Energy is daft energy and only &#8220;good&#8221; for military and space applications. Civilian nukes have no place in our land is what Japan&#8217;s population has come to agree upon. Now is the time for Renewable Energies to blossom like so many cherry blossoms&#8230;</p>
<p>Hanami Sakura, for beautiful wind flowers&#8230;</p>
<p>The Fukushima wind farm, will generate an awesome full Gigawatt of power &#8211; once completed. One full Giga of clean wind generated off the coast of Fukushima is the intelligent and rational solution coming from Japan&#8217;s Energy Ministry energy to alleviate the loss of energy from the shut down of all nuclear plants of Japan. Keep in mind that this is only the first response to the balancing act of the Base load of energy through renewable resources. Japan needs to run the whole of it&#8217;s industrial economy and provide for clean human electricity use.</p>
<p>So this is only a small part of a Grand National plan to increase renewable energy resources and supplant all nuclear power generated in the past with the Clean Energy of the future coming from the sun, the sea, geothermal and wind.  All this change of heart from government and industry officials symbiotically leaching off the teat of the most expensive and heavily subsidized energy lobby known to man &#8211; the nuclear power industry &#8211; has come because the population revolted. Popular revolt and revulsion at the corruption and criminal behaviour of the Nuclear Power Industry and Government officials that caused the disaster, has forced  the closure of all nuclear plants in Japan. This following Fukushima&#8217;s core melt down nuclear accident, and the shutdown of the nation&#8217;s 54 nuclear reactors. After four of the six Fukushima nuclear reactors and their spent fuel storage ponds went into nuclear meltdown, the radiation cloud and assorted devastation have been immense. Fukushima nuclear disaster being far worse than even Chernobyl on the ultimate scale of a magnitude 7 Nuclear disaster. In the aftermath, of the Fukushima melt down, out of Japan&#8217;s total of 54 nuclear plants, only one nuclear reactor has since come back online &#8212; and that is under the powerful auspises of METI and the old boys network.</p>
<p>So now the winds of change have brought us this wind farm near shore &#8212; offshore. The project is part of Fukushima&#8217;s plan to become completely energy self-sufficient by 2040, using renewable sources alone. This Master Plan mentioned above is going to involve all renewable energies and to prove the point, Fukushima prefecture is also set to build the country&#8217;s and perhaps the world&#8217;s, biggest solar park.</p>
<p>The Fukushima wind farm will surpass the 504 megawatts generated by the 140 turbines at the Greater Gabbard farm off the coast of Suffolk, UK – currently the world&#8217;s largest farm. This honour, will soon pass to the London Array in the Thames Estuary, where 175 turbines will produce 630 megawatts of power when it comes online later this year and later on Scotland&#8217;s coast wind farm, and Germany&#8217;s North Sea, and so on, until the Fukushima farm gets erected and be the world&#8217;s biggest by far&#8230;</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s important to note that there is no need to built interconnects here. The lines of transmission already exist as they once held and transported the base load of the nuclear reactors from the Fukuhima-Daichi nuclear plant to Tokyo. Thus when the Fukushima wind farm is up &amp; running at full power, the intention is that it will supply electricity to the existing powerful grid which Fukushima&#8217;s two nuclear power plants with six reactors each, were once connected to &#8212; thus minimizing electricity&#8217;s transmission costs and associated infrastructure built out costs. Reusing the grid is a marvelous stroke of fortune n an otherwise difficult situation&#8230;</p>
<p>This project is important and it&#8217;s also a watershed moment for Japan because is impossible to use nuclear power in Fukushima ever again.</p>
<p>And if only the clean up effort of the nuclear disaster was going as well we would all be thrilled to return to Fukushima and do business there once again.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Pano</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Well Done&#8230;. Japan.</p>
<p>Well done Mr Prime Minister Shinzō Abe. The last name Abe, has got to have something to do, with great vision and proper leadership, and successful management of the power of the office of PM. Wrestling control of the Renewable Energy Revolution from METI and the Old Boys, must not have been an easy feat. Your success speaks volumes&#8230;</p>
<p>Am certain that the powerful &#8220;metaphysical association&#8221; with the political will from your namesake and inspiring leader, Abe Lincoln &#8212; is on, and it helped break the country free from the slavery to the Amakudari.</p>
<p>Now if we could also encase and entomb the Fukushima melt down reactors and the nuclear plant, we could escape the constant release of radiation&#8230; into the sea and air, and this will make the clean up effort n Fukushima, more effective, easier and far less costly.</p>
<p>Still this change of direction towards Renewable Energies, will provide leadership for Japan at the national and international level, in this new industrial base of the Green Economy.  And as it turns out, it will augment it&#8217;s technological leadership to put some wind into it&#8217;s sales and get it out of the economic doldrums.</p>
<p>And the significance of this project should not be underestimated because it&#8217;s a great first step forward in the right direction, and a positive sign proving Japan is getting off Nuclear for good.</p>

It is estimated that this gain is the result of a recent move by long term value investor in the Energy business Warren Buffett.</p>
<p>Finally it was announced formally what we all knew for a couple of months now that MidAmerican Energy Holdings — a subsidiary of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway — had acquired the almost 600 megawatt solar development project in Southern California, which, upon completion, should provide electricity for upwards of one million US residents.</p>
<p>MidAmerican acquired the development known as the Antelope Valley Solar projects from American solar panel developers SunPower for $2.5 billion USD. And at this price it&#8217;s a steal&#8230; because the project has already signed a 30 year PPA with the local Power Utility company. Like buying an energy plant that it&#8217;s complete output is going to be fully pre-sold for thirty years to a triple AAA rated P&amp;U company. Naturally Mr Buffet uses our invention &#8220;the Green Bonds&#8221; to finance part of this transaction since the project SPV company is investment grade and the bonds are investment grade AAA as well. The public appetite for this type of bonds is great as proven in the past with the first time Mr Buffet used thee bonds for the purchase of another solar farm and we see a virtuous cycle pattern forming. [PPA is a long term Power Purchase Agreement between a Solar developer and a blue chip Power &amp; Utility Co]</p>
<p>Construction of the project is set to begin in the first quarter of 2013 and is expected to be complete by the end of 2015. When it is complete, the two solar panel arrays will comprise the largest solar power project in the World.</p>
<p>To put the size of this project into perspective, consider this: one megawatt is one million watts and a solar panel an individual might install on their own roof is typically about 230 watts. This means the project is equivalent to more than 2.5 million of these 230-watt panels.</p>
<p>The MidAmerican investment comes as good news for the solar industry as it has taken a few hits over the past couple years.</p>
<p>In Europe — the largest solar power market in the World — government funding and support for solar energy has declined as of late and selling prices of solar panels hit the floor after a massive oversupply of panels flooded the market.</p>
<p>Solar Cells are already a commodity manufacturing business. Oversupply and Moore&#8217;s law effect on microchips has now fully embraced this most basic and cheapest to manufacture microchip. Prices have gone down as low in extremis to 60 cents per Kw. Consolidation and aggregation in the Solar Manufacture Business has been fierce, but the fundamentals are great.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great long term value business for those that pick up assets from that restructure their debt or just pick up the assets from the auction block, and go out to built this as a simple commodity business very much like making matches or toilet paper. You got to have plants everywhere because it doesn&#8217;t pay to ship this type of cheap commoditized product very far and being close to the install base also supports the replacement and upkeep and continuous improvement these plants require.</p>
<p>By picking up assets and companies that iterate well with low costs and good technological throughput &#8211; you win both races. And as we are nearing the bottom of the trough, it&#8217;s good to know that by weeding out the unfit, the Solar energy industry has gone from 750 solar module and solar cell manufacturing companies in the World in 2010 to about 150 semi-viable firms still producing cells competitively by the end of year 2012.  So the number had dropped to 150 contenders and will drop even further soon. Maybe one fifth of those in existence today will see the light of Sun by New year 2015.</p>
<p>The reason that the survivors will drop way further is obvious if one compares this fairly novel industry to the development and upkeep of the computer chip making industry and it&#8217;s trajectory.  What happened to the manufacturers of chips for computing &#8212; will happen to the solar photovoltaic chip makers. And as we mentioned the vaunted Moore&#8217;s Law coursing through the system regardless of various government subsidies, intervention and support mechanisms &#8212; the effect has been somewhat cushioned and instead of all of it happening at once it has been spread over the space of a few years. Advise to government Energy departments worldwide: &#8220;You can only buck the tides for so long before you are inundated and both You and long term value investors need to remember this well.&#8221;</p>
<p>My long term and short term VIEWS are as follows:</p>
<p>The solar energy industry will soon face another big hit as another round of firms get consolidated and aggregated this year as the price of solar cells drops to 50 cents and stabilizes there to observe Grid Parity with coal worldwide.</p>
<p>This in turn will power up another huge demand, same as that announced by China and now by the US most dynamic and conservative long term value investor, and all the boat will be lifted by the tide with the price remaining stable in the 50 -60 cents per Kw in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>And this way, we could soon see a bit of a recovery thanks in part to these XL investments made by our friend Warren Buffett &#8212;  last year and this year too.</p>
<p>So how do you take advantage of this?</p>
<p>Sadly, you can&#8217;t do it like Buffet no matter how much you&#8217;d like to emulate the big guy.</p>
<p>Maybe you can dance like Mick Jagger and drink like Richard Barton, but You still can&#8217;t do it like Buffet.</p>
<p>Because for smaller investors the amount of leverage required is out there and you can&#8217;t invest directly in Green Bonds because they aren&#8217;t available for non institutional investors and well &#8212; you don&#8217;t own a Utility company like MidAmerican to spot the leveraged finance against it&#8217;s balance sheet&#8230;.</p>
<p>So what is a passionate Solar enthusiast and Warren B. follower must do to get in the ground floor if this game?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t despair &#8211; we&#8217;ve got solutions.</p>
<p>Follow on because we now have a new way for you to participate in this steady same returns game Buffet enjoys, and that the long term PPA with a P&amp;U majors provide. Yet because, there are still a few fundamental problems with investing directly into solar energy as a private small family investor. It&#8217;s a big dollars game and only open to institutional investors mainly. It&#8217;s large ticket for the admission even for most PE firms&#8230;</p>
<p>Regular folks and small investors &#8211; Mom &amp; Pop investors balancing the check book around the computer or in the kitchen table, need to be able to participate in this revolution of Energy for us to solve the problem.  Yet because people can invest money into the stock market and purchase stocks of a solar company, that doesn&#8217;t mean they are investing in solar energy, but rather in a listed company that usually manufactures the cells&#8230; And as we said earlier, this business has been murdered and still is an ongoing bloodbath. And since investing in a working &#8220;abattoir&#8221; is not for the faint of heart or the ones investing the family kitty &#8212; let&#8217;s look elsewhere.<br />
What I suggest is this:</p>
<p>First go ahead and install solar panels on your roof. And while You are at it, put a solar water heater up there too. You&#8217;ll get massive returns on that investment and it&#8217;s all gravy. Hot water and your own electricity and perhaps central heating from the sun and No taxes for the investment returns &#8211; if anything a tax break in most municipalities. When an individual places a solar panel on their roof, they may use the energy for their own needs, or sell it back to the grid making their meter spin backwards, or receive tax breaks and reductions on their energy bill&#8230; Or they may opt to receive special electricity tariffs FIT rates from the utility &#8212; guaranteed by the government &#8212; who siphons the generated electricity back up into the power grid. Still producing electricity from your own photovoltaics &#8211; PV cells &#8211; is the most democratic way of energy production and the most local, efficient and direct use of your capital. It is also the most environment and community friendly method of investing in Solar Energy. Long term this is the best method of solar investment and it also adds value to your own home. What&#8217;s not to like about this investment that will keep you warm and cozy in the colds of winter simply by hooking up the solar water heater to the central heating system and augmenting it with solar electricity produced on your roof from your own photovoltaic panels. Do this and you&#8217;ll Thank me for it for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Second if you want to trade dollars for dollars, you ought to find a way to invest in other people&#8217;s larger Solar Power projects in a location near you. And that takes some digging around and finding the local Solar developer and if you live in the areas where the sun is not plentiful, you must find the Solar Power Association in the State, City and address you like and then go ahead and do this via a direct investment in a cooperative or community project, or a new company project that allows this. It all works very much like a REIT. A real Estate Investment Trust for Solar Energy production from the roof or greenfield opportunity. Large Solar developers and reputable Operators do this all the time, but they don&#8217;t advertise on late night TV, so be cautious with the people you get in bed. still all of it is gonna work out with the required due diligence. Yet this method i a little bit more than most people and small investors are willing to handle.</p>
<p>Third method is to invest in a distributed fashion. And this is good because it leaves the diligence nad hard work to the professionals. And as luck would have it is now available because of a brand new company that is called Mosaic. Mosaic, based out of Oakland, California, is a company that allows individuals the ability to invest in solar energy, similarly to the way that Buffett just has. After all California has about 80% of all new Solar projects in the US today &#8230;  So it&#8217;s a good bet.<br />
Mosaic allows individuals to invest directly into solar projects through crowd-funding. Founded over two years ago, the company operates through a unique business model that could truly revolutionize the way people invest in green energies.<br />
Solar projects are often expensive and require large amounts of funding. What Mosaic does is connect investors with solar projects that need funding. It’s sort of like Kickstarter for solar projects.</p>
<p>So go ahead and make Solar part of your investment kitty this year because it looks rather promising.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Pano</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Make sure now to invest directly in solar projects in your rooftop and in your own backyard&#8230; so to speak.</p>
<p>REMEMBER: Avoid investing in Solar manufacture and just go ahead and make your mark by investing in local and distributed solar energy production from photovoltaic cells in your rooftop and other people&#8217;s rooftops &#8230; Quite Simple really.</p>
<p>And with this new Mosaic thing &#8212; you can enjoy the same rates of return like Mr Buffet, without having to front the $2.5 Billion ticket to just play the game.<br />
In Mosaic, the return for the investor initial investment, is a steady same rate of return &#8211; as it derives from the building and development funding mechanism and the PPA deal the Project owners have negotiated with the Power &amp; Utility company that acquires the produced energy.</p>
<p>And when the projects are complete, the people who pay for the electricity provided by the solar projects, generate revenues, which Mosaic then pays out to its investors incrementally increasing their returns.<br />
Although the Solar Projects Mosaic funds are of a much smaller scale than the one just purchased by Buffet&#8217;s MidAmerican, Mosaic allows individuals the ability to invest in green energy opportunities previously unavailable to them and get a good to great rate of return.  Still due to regulation, only CA and NY residents can play for now&#8230;</p>

<div id="id_50f6d33c083bb5c34891309">My JetLag 2013 &#8212; Good morning &#8212; Am in the midst of another global series of University centred events that kick start Innovative StartUps that matter. Am teaching Innovation for Start Up companies that solve the really Big Problems out there and provide humanity with technical, scientific and engineering solutions to serve humanity.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Am dog tired &#8212; Yet am not minding it because we are creating great companies, sustainable Social Enterprise, profitable businesses and incredible start ups with the best and the brightest the world has to offer. And it makes me feel rather good that we have these going concerns to help us stand on our side to stem the tides and fight the battle of our present &amp; future challenges.  That&#8217;s reward enough for me&#8230;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Jet Lag be damned. We&#8217;ve created 20 companies this year alone .  Not too bad for the first month of 2013&#8230;</div>

<p>It is a really important to pay attention sometimes.</p>
<p>Like a kid observing the ants in a playground.</p>
<p>Or an adult looking at the Sudoku pages in the subway.</p>
<p>Pay close attention as if you are going to solve a problem and meed to input all the facts.</p>
<p>Now I say this only because, people haven’t learned to pay attention in their busy 24/7/365 interconnected world&#8230;.</p>
<p>Yeah, we scan a lot of things. We read a thousand emails a day and send a few hundreds too&#8230;</p>
<p>We think we pay attention to colleagues when we are all the time multitasking and FB glancing&#8230;</p>
<p>When was the last time you really paid attention to something serious outside of work and family?</p>
<p>I mean pay attention seriously to the small things&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those inconsequential little minor things.</p>
<p>The creatures we step on when walking about.</p>
<p>The people we pretend to not look at because of their appearance: Maybe handicap, poverty, illness, misfortune, social station and beggarly look&#8230; all non conforming looks.</p>
<p>The events that are too horrific to consider glancing at the news for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the hate mail you receive because you try to do good&#8230;</p>
<p>Yet these things demand our attention too.</p>
<p>Even if they are unpleasant to look at.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t shy away from the visual and sometimes visceral pain.</p>
<p>Look at things.</p>
<p>Better yet: Pay Attention to them and you&#8217;ll learn something new.</p>
<p>A new wisdom will arise out of your paying attention. Wisdom both inwards and outwards.</p>
<p>Know Thyself.</p>
<p>You cannot know yourself if you don&#8217;t ay attention.</p>
<p>Because Attention deficit is all around us.</p>
<p>We call America the Ritalin nation because almost a third of her children are on the drug for ADD&#8230;</p>
<p>And in my opinion many adults need to be on it too&#8230;</p>
<p>Because we lack the capacity to pay attention.</p>
<p>And chances are you haven&#8217;t learned to pay attention also.</p>
<p>And if you haven’t learned to pay attention &#8212; then chances are &#8212; you haven&#8217;t learned that there’s nothing that doesn’t need to happen.</p>
<p>In life and business.</p>
<p>There’s also nothing that you should say &#8220;that shouldn’t happen&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nothing at all.</p>
<p>Pay attention here:</p>
<p>Rather, it’s the most important thing to learn to pay attention to all of these things and more&#8230;</p>
<p>And if you learn to pay attention &#8212; well, there is freedom to be found in attention.</p>
<p>Because in paying attention, there is a way of doing it mind fully and living on purpose.</p>
<p>Being present i the moment you occupy and being in the way where you are not caught, trapped, oppressed, influenced, or driven by what’s going on, inside or outside yourself and in the world at large.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember it&#8217;s the little thing that matter.</p>
<p>pay Attention to them and the big things will take care of themselves.</p>
<p>And that gives you a tremendous power to go about your life.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Pano</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>Because if you have the ability not to be pushed around by your inner and outer compulsions, the Big scary thoughts or the fear du jour, or from the daily pressures of the world &#8212; well, then you are FREE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FREE to dream&#8230;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FREE to create</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FREE to live</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Or is it a slightly different conundrum?</p>
<p>Yes, our World is becoming a giant food-waste landfill created by the West.</p>
<p>But maybe not in order to fight off the starving masses of the global South and the East. It only becomes so by careless accident, bad management, and lack of accountability for limitations and externalities and the law of unintended consequences.</p>
<p>Just believe me &#8212; because the other way is how the &#8220;Conspiracy Theory&#8221; master minds like you to think&#8230; and in the process drive you crazy or start writing complex screenplays for Hollywood &#8211; in order to feed your insecurities and your monkey mind&#8217;s runaway fears and imagination.</p>
<p>But we are better than that&#8230;</p>
<p>And we reckon that this Food Waste Big Problem is One Problem that we can solve.</p>
<p>Of course we recognize that it&#8217;s not going to happen overnight, and not with the same kind of thinking that created it in the first place.</p>
<p>We need to upgrade our software. Upgrade our thinking that is. We simply need to innovate our way out of the corner we painted ourselves into. And this way we will adapt to the Environmental challenges and mitigate our disatrous wasteful behaviour too. And we will&#8230; because now we have the solutions and we also create Green Innovation Start Ups in order to solve this global security crisis&#8230;</p>
<p>Because make no mistake &#8211; this is a security crisis of the first degree.</p>
<p>And a New Report that just came out from the Environmental Parliament&#8217;s Science Advisory Board just quantifies how unsustainable that is&#8230; and how BIG a PROBLEM this is for all of us. And what a nightmare it might end up being for the World&#8217;s Safety and Security if left untreated and unaddressed.</p>
<p>Basically, we throw away more than half of our food. Like spoiled children of plenty&#8230;</p>
<p>We throw out to waste upwards of 50% of all the global production of food and agricultural product. And if we add all the externalities we reach the incredible feat of throwing away more than 60% of all food produced on this planet. And that&#8217;s without counting the additional externalities required in the food production process as outside inputs. From the crucially scarce externalities such as the precious fresh water, all the energy inputs, the resultant pollution, the red bloom creating agricultural runoff of pesticides and nitrogen based petrochemicals, and all that CO2 going up into the open sewer we call atmosphere, and all of the unlikely externalities we have no measure for in our current accounting books&#8230;</p>
<p>Yet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s completely insane when you think of it.</p>
<p>Still, we have to personalize it in order to really understand it.</p>
<p>You get it?</p>
<p>Because making it personal works best for us humans, simply since it attracts selfish attention to our thinking processes.</p>
<p>After all we are all narcissistic human beings, rulers of the planet, members of the exceptional species, the chosen lot, &#8230; ad nauseum&#8230;</p>
<p>So here we go. Let&#8217;s understand this together. I&#8217;ll break it down.  We&#8217;ll start with a Socratic Dialogue of a few key questions&#8230;</p>
<p>Do you have an idea of how much perfectly edible food you throw away directly or indirectly each and every hour of the  day?</p>
<p>Do you ever measure how much food you throw when you clean your pantry, shelves, freezer, refrigerator and perishables containers? Both at work and at home.</p>
<p>Do you ever think about this? Especially come Friday, Saturday afternoon, or Sunday morning &#8212; on your times of introspection &#8212; depending on your religious convictions.</p>
<p>And do you ever think of how much food gets thrown away on your behalf starting at the farm?</p>
<p>And how much food gets rejected and wasted by the far too many middle men?</p>
<p>And what of all the food thrown away by the Supermarket buying agents, choosing always the prettiest unripe hard body veg and fruit?</p>
<p>And then how much food gets trashed in the long line of production, transport, distribution and delivery to your local supermarket?</p>
<p>And what of the food thrown out when the unripe fruit and veg has to go to ripening ovens to make it Unwooden and palatable?</p>
<p>Am sure you now know that a whole lot of food is thrown away&#8230;</p>
<p>But do you know how much?</p>
<p>No idea eh?</p>
<p>Thought so.</p>
<p>Now take a moment and listen:</p>
<p>Let me tell You&#8230;.</p>
<p>When most food that reaches our table has traveled more miles than you travel the entire year &#8212; it&#8217;s obvious that a whole lot of it is lost, wasted, spoiled and thrown away.</p>
<p>Poor food appearance, general food fashion cosmetics and people&#8217;s overconsumption are another major reason of massive food waste.</p>
<p>And if you think that for your dinner table there are about 300,000 people working in the background &#8212; up and down the value food chain just to fill your table up &#8212; you can understand that the system is really inefficient.</p>
<p>Yes. That is correct: Three hundred thousand &#8211; 300,00 &#8211; people working to fulfill your private dietary needs. That is if by accident of DNA, you live in the First world. It&#8217;s a long line of human &#8220;cogs&#8221; in the long chain of command and process geared for the food economy. Even the Emperor of China didn&#8217;t employ so many people to feed his court and the whole Mandarin bureaucrat class. And the Sun King Louis XVI, of France who lost his head because he had 3,000 people in the food chain employed to source, gather, select, transport, deliver and cook his food&#8230;. and taste it too.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder we are losing our heads too ?</p>
<p>Is it because we are becoming modern day Marie Antoinettes ?</p>
<p>Yet in all seriousness a lot more than half of our food ends up in the garbage bin, and results in landfill filling sin in the West. That explains how come out of the whole global production of food over half gets thrown away&#8230;</p>
<p>And this finding echoes the results of a study published by the Environmental Parliament this week. The study estimates that of the 4 billion metric tons of food we produce each year, between 2 and 2.2 billion tons never gets eaten by the people and goes to landfills as waste and garbage.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a good looking statistic, given that according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, 1,870 million people remain underfed in poor countries across the South and the East.</p>
<p>One has to think hard how to solve this problem now.</p>
<p>Even in China that food waste is abhorred &#8212; especially since the great Steersman dictated a &#8220;long garden leave&#8221; to the far &amp; &#8220;beautiful&#8221; territorial villages, for anyone caught throwing away food &#8211; wasteful practices have now peaked. people&#8217;s overconsumption and direct waste, have started creeping in.</p>
<p>Chinese really do not waste food at all&#8230; and they practice charity. But most importantly, they recycle all the food waste into the animals around the home garden, homestead, or farm. But Western practices have started coming in with the attendant problems of nouveau bourgeois mentality. And food waste is apparently one of the main Western influences.</p>
<p>Simply buying more than you can use is the root of the problem. And apply that all the way up and down the food chain from farm to landfill and you see how come half the world&#8217;s food is thrown away when one third of all people on this Earth, goes hungry and starving&#8230;</p>
<p>Still some signs of unwarranted wealth caused flagrant overconsumption appear everywhere now in China: It&#8217;s at the usual places where the Western junk food shops throw away food massively. Because their method of production and cooking is automated and timely, they throw away massive quantities of food daily.  And so do the Western type of supermarkets and they all promptly get fined by the inspectors roaming the garbage bins. But these businesses prefer to continue their wasteful ways, because in their economic balance sheet, it&#8217;s a small price to pay. So they prefer to pay the middling little fine and keep throwing away foods daily, rather than change their ways.</p>
<p>And so the conundrum becomes global and universal. Instead of solving the inequalities and waste we tend to enlarge them to the extremes.</p>
<p>But as an Innovator I have thought of this long and hard and have invested in various Green Start Ups to reduce the waste from Farm to the Table. And we need many more start Ups to solve this. Green Innovation Start Ups and entrepreneurship to address this massive issue.</p>
<p>The greatest single cause of food waste today is exactly the same as the cause of atheism in the world today. And in China more than elsewhere is that Christians, Moslems and all other traditional religions who acknowledge charity, prudence, and food efficiency, with their lips &#8211; walk out the temple door and immediately deny  the bespoke &#8220;Kindness, Compassion and Charity&#8221;  with their lifestyle.</p>
<p>That is what the Party doctrine, dialectic materialism and simple ethical atheism practiced in an &#8220;unbelieving&#8221; world simply finds unbelievable.</p>
<p>Yet our religion is Compassion&#8230;</p>
<p>Our religion is Charity&#8230;</p>
<p>Our religion is Kindness&#8230;</p>
<p>But our Acumen is Business sharp.</p>
<p>And our processes are financial accounting proper.</p>
<p>And our Green Start Ups are marvels of technological progress and entrepreneurial prowess.</p>
<p>So we will solve the problem of food waste with Innovation, Technology, Business method and Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>We have already started doing this by building companies worldwide to solve this and all such problems from the Molecular level up.</p>
<p>We call the process: &#8220;Green Innovation Start Up&#8221; and its on a global tour schedule again this year.</p>
<p>Over the last few year we have built more than two hundred companies addressing just such issues and still we need to build many more. The problem is that BIG.</p>
<p>Still solving it is Simple.</p>
<p>And the process starts here.</p>
<p>Sign up and attend one of our Master Classes on Green Innovation Start Ups 2013 in Europe, Asia, and America:</p>
<p>Here are some prospective dates and places:</p>

<p>Later on back in Europe&#8217;s top schools in Cambridge, Oxford, London, Paris, Rome, Berlin and Barcelona and &#8230;.</p>
<p>Our process is simple: We start worthwhile companies to solve the Big Problems of the world. No clickactivism, no BS, no silly Apps, no games, no useless crap, no gimmicks, no &#8220;built it and they will come&#8230;&#8221; pie in the sky, no ukulele playing, or any other kind of playing either&#8230;</p>
<p>We simply create great Companies and Social Enterprises built around the basis of human and environmental needs and unsolved persistent problems &#8211; we have identified as top five or top ten issues facing us squarely in the eyes.</p>
<p>We create really useful companies and that&#8217;s why they stick around successfully. And we have had a far better success record than any incubator, VC firm, or Accelerator, out there.</p>
<p>We succeed simply because we solve REAL PROBLEMS for real human beings with passionate young entrepreneurs as visionary leaders .</p>
<p>We Start Simple:</p>
<p>So for this huge problem as identified by the Environmental Parliament as a global priority &#8212; we start by asking the three important and most right Questions:</p>
<p>1) What are the resource implications of the insane food waste around the world?</p>
<p>2) What measures we need to take?</p>
<p>3) And what technologies we could deploy now to solve this problem?</p>
<p>The Answers to the above questions will determine the process most start Ups from our program will take n in China and perhaps elsewhere. Remember it is easier to solve this kind of problem before it becomes entrenched in Society. And that is why China is a better example because it can leapfrog the failed ways from the West. Same as in Clean Energy deployment and telecommunications.</p>
<p>Because the main reasons food is wasted differ between rich, poor and intermediate countries &#8212; but waste is most profligate and avoidable in rich countries. Yet there is where it is almost impossible to root it out even when the economic conditions have worsened as in the last few years of the Great Recession.</p>
<p>Here is a Primer of Solutions for Innovative Entrepreneur and start Up Leaders: Environmental Parliament suggest we build solutions around these great Big Themes:</p>
<p>Come and let&#8217;s identify the issue specific and molecular part of the solution and we will fund a Start Up for you. We help you do whatever you want to build around this problem, and we will support You to productize, iterate, scale, and grow. To tart with we will offer you a ticket to one of our Global Tour of Green Innovation Start Ups this year 2013, in order to meet you, to fund you, help you and grow your company.</p>
<p>It is a huge Global problem of the greatest magnitude because typically, way more than half of all the food on the planet ends up in landfills.</p>
<p>Of course the problem stems from the richer countries where an astonishing, sixty to seventy percent of the food, ends up in the trash. Food that travels many miles to come to your shopping cart and then travels again another hundred miles or so towards the landfills. Even when there are people and children going hungry in the very same communities that waste the food &#8211; this is the rule in the so called Civilized world.</p>
<p>Example is the US, where the biggest waste stems from the superbuying culture. people always buy larger and larger packages of stuff that we normally reserve for businesses in the rest of the world. Business Clubs, like Walton&#8217;s Club, Costco, Cash &amp; Carry, Giant Tescos and all other hyper supermarkets have Americans lined up with big cars and even specially bought mini vans and full size trucks to fill them up with junk food and some necessary victuals&#8230;</p>
<p>I put it all down to the incredible food insecurity the American people have.</p>
<p>Their idea of food security trumps the world over. maybe it&#8217;s a remnant of the illogical fear from the time of the Cold War. Bombarded with images of Nuclear Winter, people bought peas and beans in cans and frozen waffles to outlast the End of the World in their TV equipped sub-basement shelters&#8230; And they buy guns and ammunition too to fight off other hoarders who might come looking for more beans and bacon.</p>
<p>American people buy and store tons &#8211; literally tons &#8211; of food and hoard all that food in their shelters or just within the home. All of that food of course ends up in the landfills.</p>
<p>Still families engage into this insanity almost by default and it becomes the default mentality all over the developed world as well. Homes in America are like homes in the range. They have basement and garage food storage shelves and truck size bins, walk in pantries, double door refrigerators [larger than anybody's clothes closet in the UK] and have additional double freezers in their garages and basements, running through additional electricity generator [if the lights go out] and have their own fuel storage too&#8230;</p>
<p>Methinks &#8212; their food could probably outlive them</p>
<p>All, Americans are engaged in long term storage of food fearful of  the eventuality of a nuclear Armageddon, a super storm, or a simple snow in. This or maybe fearing the moment when dystopia &#8211; organized by Hollywood &#8211; steps out of the TV and enters their living room and takes over their lives. Those media generated fears lead to overconsumption and of course the friendly Americans think that all that canned food and frozen shit, might become useful&#8230;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for all of us &#8212; this insecure thinking is well past it&#8217;s expiration date.</p>
<p>Then You have the criminal junk food culture, that induces people to overconsume as a critical economic issue. It is similar to the cheap alcohol offered by the supermarkets and distributors in the UK. Same in America where economic choices lead the garbage food purveyors to feed Americans large quantities of junk fast food in seemingly cheaper deals and includes supersized portions that customers simply can&#8217;t manage to hold down, and all the &#8220;eat as much as you want&#8221; offers in restaurants and the cheap commodity lard and sugar enhanced staples food at the grocery stores. In the US, UK, and EU, health &amp; safety dictated over-conservative sell-by dates on labels and two-for-one offers of perishable items and other gimmicks to pa the abundant spoilage ready food to waste into the consumers shopping carts.</p>
<p>These are the key factors to waste of food, encouraging consumers to buy too much food to start with, and to throw away items that have reached their sell-by date, but which are still edible. The problem, is that the sell-by dates are selected not to protect us from rotten food, but to give supermarkets huge safety margins – minimising any risk of consumers eating their products, getting ill and then suing them. This present a huge opportunity for Innovation and</p>
<p>Another factor in rich countries is that consumers may shun oddly shaped vegetables. This, says the survey, leads to as much as 30 per cent of vegetable harvests being rejected by supermarkets – again, a huge and unnecessary waste.</p>
<p>In developing countries, poor transport and storage systems lead to much food being lost before it even gets to the shop: for example, 45 per cent of rice is lost in this way in China, and as much as 80 per cent in Vietnam. In the poorest countries, much food is also lost through poor handling by farmers.</p>
<p>All this is bad enough, but it gets even worse when the resources used to produce wasted food are taken into account. Huge amounts of water go to waste with every morsel of food thrown into the bin. The report says that about 70 per cent of our fresh water globally goes into producing food, with meat being far more resource-hungry than vegetables. Each kilogram of beef requires 15,415 litres of water, compared with 237 litres for a kilo of cabbage. Chocolate is even more water-hungry, though, needing 17,196 litres per kilo.</p>
<p>Then there is the energy squandered in producing wasted food. Typically, says the report, 7 to 10 calories go into producing every calorie we get from food. Again, meat is the most costly, with beef requiring 35 calories per calorie of nutrition, compared to 3 calories for veg. In richer countries, much of the energy on the production side goes into making fertiliser and pesticides, which account for half the energy needed to grow wheat, for example.</p>
<p>One day, it may be possible for all crops to make their own fertiliser directly from nitrogen in the air, just as peas and beans do at present, but it will take decades for this research to yield results. Meanwhile, the energy wasted each year in discarded food in the US exceeds that obtained from the country&#8217;s offshore oil and gas reserves.</p>
<p>Wasting food also has implications for land use. Around half the world&#8217;s 100 million square kilometres of fertile land is already used to grow food. A single hectare can supply rice or potatoes for 19 to 22 people, but would only feed one or two if turned over to producing lamb or beef, says the report.</p>
<p>That use of precious land is in vain if food is thrown out. It may be that all meat will one day be &#8221;grown&#8221; as tissue in large fermenters, which would reduce the area required to produce beef, for example, by 99 per cent, while also saving huge amounts of water. But again, that day is decades away.</p>
<p>The best, fastest and simplest solution to all this waste, says the report, is for consumers in rich countries to buy less food and make better use of what they do buy, throwing less away. Developing and poorer countries should work towards better transport links and adopt technologies that raise yields and prevent waste in harvesting and storage.</p>
<p>&#8220;The potential to provide 60 to 100 per cent more food by simply eliminating losses, while simultaneously freeing up land, energy and water resources for other use, is an opportunity that should not be ignored,&#8221; concludes the report.</p>
<p>Thank God though because we have INNOVATION.</p>
<p>GREEN INNOVATION to be precise.</p>
<p>And here are some companies we want to built:</p>
<p>Because if we simply can&#8217;t break our habit of chucking food out, there is an emerging, if slightly yucky, idea that could help us out – using maggots to convert food waste and even manure into protein that can be fed back to animals.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s built this company together.</p>
<p>Love Start Ups that solve Big Problems&#8230;</p>
<p>And if you think this is an extreme example &#8211; think again.  Because we already have started a company like that and as you are well aware people eat incects throughout the developing world. As a matter of fact three quarters of humanity consume insect protein because this is the most plentiful and sustainable source of protein out there&#8230;</p>
<p>And soon &#8211; if we have anything to do with this &#8211; our children in the US, the UK and the rest of Europe will be able to eat healthy sustainable protein sourced from insect generated biomass.</p>
<p>Here are some Examples of this and of some other Start Ups I support and work on through the Universities across Europe, Asia and the US&#8230;<br />
Here is the Forbes magazine review of our Start Up Green Innovation in Paris this December: <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/ricardogeromel/2012/11/27/paris-startup-weekend-goes-green-winner-wants-to-sell-insects-as-food-for-kids/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow nofollow">http://www.forbes.com/sites/ricardogeromel/2012/11/27/paris-startup-weekend-goes-green-winner-wants-to-sell-insects-as-food-for-kids/</a><br />
&#8220;Paris Startup Weekend Goes Green: Winner Wants to Sell Insects as Food for Kids&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Dietary adjustments are but a small concession to our incoming demanding reality that requires all humanity to innovate and try new thing, new ways, and new food sources.</p>
<p>And this is what the future looks like:</p>
<p>Rising population to Ten Billion people, combined with improved nutrition standards and shifting dietary preferences will exert serious conflict, social and economic pressures for dramatic increases in the global food supply.  Governors, Premieres, Leaders and prime Ministers, along with Engineers, scientists and agriculturalists have the knowledge, tools and systems that will assist us in achieving the much needed productivity increases.</p>
<p>However, the pressure will grow on the limits to growth. Our finite resources of land, energy and water are insufficient to achieve this without vast improvements and Innovation. The potential to provide 60–100% more food by simply eliminating losses, while simultaneously freeing up land, energy and water resources for other uses, is a critical component of this strategy and also presents an opportunity that should not be ignored.</p>
<p>In order to begin tackling the challenge, the Environmental Parliament recommends that we built new innovative businesses that address these five Big Problems before our world&#8217;s food based economy becomes the proverbial &#8220;Too Big To Fail&#8221; &#8212; failed institution:</p>
<p>Here are the Five Big problem solving Opportunities and the Public Policy envelope that will wield the risk:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>The US department of Agriculture (USDA) along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the White House, must work with the international Environmental Parliament and the community of global problem solvers, third sector and Social enterprises to address the issue of food security globally and not nationally.  Same thing applies for the UK and the EU.  Europe and America must start looking inward and outward at the same time in order to feed and heal a sharply divide planet of humanity begging for food and at the same time having way too much elsewhere. A simple Business management case of a problem that can be solved with proactive engagement, load management, and efficiency thinking. All these Business processes are well understood and our ranks are filled with people and professional managers endowed to solve this problem. We have all the talent in our corporate world &#8212; yet we never use it to solve this Biggest of Problems. The issue of malnutrition, famine, caloric intake inequality, and 2/3 of our food waste is what am talking about solving here.</p>
<p>WHY?</p>
<p>Because global stability is the best recipe for global security. And although, some strategic and diplomatic people think that by controlling food the Wesst controls the restive developing world &#8212; I don&#8217;t believe in conspiracy theories having seen my share of them. I simply believe in the malady of human malice and lack of Compassion.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s now start thinking globally of our security being linked to the safety and security of others, and yet we still have to work locally to solve this global problem. Waste Not &#8211; Want not. All the food that doesn&#8217;t get wasted can be redirected where it matters. The message has already reached a fresh meaning and urgency.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>The European national and supranational Agricultural agencies and  the European Union Food &amp; Agriculture Organisation must work with the international community to ensure that the standards adopted can be compatible with the religions and feeding mechanisms of the world&#8217;s diverse populations that ultimately rely on the five big staples to feed the world. Ah.. and let&#8217;s get off the habit of eating dead carcasses for our protein. It&#8217;s not just bad Karma &#8212; it&#8217;s both bad form and really stupidly wasteful.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) must work with the international community to ensure governments of developed nations put in place programmes that transfer knowledge, design know-how, and suitable technology to newly developing countries. This will help improve produce handling in the harvest, and immediate post-harvest stages of food production.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Governments of Western nations and all those rapidly developing countries ought to sit down together and exchange ideas of how to incorporate food waste minimization,  water optimization, load management thinking, and Business practices into the agricultural production, sourcing, transport infrastructure and storage facilities, currently being planned, engineered and built.</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>Governments in developed nations should devise and implement economic policy that changes consumer behaviour, food related business practices and profit expectations, same as using economic psychology to nudge people off meat, off hoarding food, and recycling waste to food again&#8230;</p>
<p>These practices should discourage also the retailers from wasteful practices that lead to the rejection of food at the source simply because of appearance, cosmetic characteristics, and due date. People can consume tastier food that is closer to maturity. I prefer ripe fruits always and know they are far better for my health than hardbodied fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>We should also work to sharply alter consumer behaviour, remove the undue and illogical fear of food shortages from the popular mind, and thus prevent foodwaste and serious losses of food in the home due to excessive purchasing by consumers and then throwing it all away.</p>
<p>By building businesses around these issues we are going to be resilient and solve the Big problem of food waste quickly before we turn to cannibalizing our meagre remaining ecosystems.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Dr Kroko</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p><i>Since more than half of our food goes to waste even as nearly two billion people remain underfed in poorer countries, we have to develop those measures and technologies that could help us get on top of the problem.</i></p>
<p>So Join me on the Global Tour this year and see some successes to thrill you, solve Big Problems and become rich and famous in the process &#8211; as well&#8230;</p>
<p>And date super models, travel the world in a private jet, become a gazillionaire and then realize that You are really solving the World&#8217;s Big Problems and feel really good about yourself because aside from all the other silly perks &#8212; I promise You &#8212; You&#8217;ll get the vaunted Meaning of Life.</p>
<p>But for now, while all these potentially game-changing technologies are developed and we built those rockin Start Ups, the best solution has to be to buy less and make sure you eat what you buy.</p>
<p>Relax&#8230; Nuclear Winter is not in the cards for now&#8230;</p>
<p>Never mind the Bollocks that scare you witless with the Mullahs, the Korans and the Koreans&#8230;</p>
