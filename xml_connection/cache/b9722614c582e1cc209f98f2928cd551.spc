<h1 style="text-align: center;">HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE LEANGAINS METHOD OF INTERMITTENT FASTING TO REACH LOW LEVELS OF BODY FAT</h1>
<p>The Leangains Method of Intermittent Fasting was developed by Martin Berkhan. It has helped many individuals reach insanely low body fat levels, while liberating them from the unnecessary tasks consistent with the 6 small meals a day dogma, as well as other discomforts that accompany a daily calorie deficit. The intent of this article is to arm one with the tools necessary to develop their own plan, and provide guidance to make smart adjustments when the need arises.</p>
<p>I stumbled across Martin’s blog in 2009 (he started it in 2007). I was instantly intrigued and immersed myself in the posts until I had read every single one in a matter of a couple weeks. Also, at the same time I friended him on Facebook, which at the time his page was more like a Q&amp;A forum where he answered any and all questions and it was a community of quite a few of us conducting personal experiments on ourselves and others with his methods.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I witnessed Martin transform from a willing expert on his methods eager to tell anyone who cared how to achieve the best body composition of their life – into an internet douchebag who belittled those who came to his page (BTW I really don’t blame him much, because I was able to see the trend of people asking the exact same questions day in and day out without reading ANY of his guidelines on the blog. This, I imagine would start to get on your nerves…in any case, that’s just the way it turned out).</p>
<p>The reason why this is all relevant is because those of us who were able to communicate with him and the community before this whole IF thing blew up, got so much great advice and other knowledge nuggets that were missed in some of the articles. To add to the confusion around his methods there were tons of others who took his material and either unintentionally screwed it up when they put it up on their site, or purposefully changed things on their own accord. Don’t get me wrong, tweaking some things is good and at most times necessary, but it had sort of a telephone effect on the web…one person puts their spin on Martin’s methods, then someone else reads that and puts their spin on it all the while calling it Leangains. I would like to offer some of the many things that I have learned throughout my LG IF journey as well as some of the things I have observed from others who I have guided.</p>
<p>The first thing is that there are several different protocols depending on what your overall goal is. Once you establish your goal, that dictates the degree of calorie cycling that you employ (+/- Maintenance (M)). Your goals can fit into one of four main categories, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fat Loss/Muscle Maintenance – very slow muscle gain is possible</li>
<li>Recomp – Gain Muscle Slowly/Lose Fat Slowly – at the same time</li>
<li>LeanGain Muscle/Little to no Fat Gain</li>
<li>Maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, most people misunderstand the LEANGAINS METHOD as the RECOMP protocol, which is most commonly M+20%/M-20%. While this is correct for the RECOMP protocol, this is also the one which produces the slowest results. When the results don’t come fast enough they start freaking out and changing things the wrong way and end up with a bastardized version, but still call it Leangains, and then dismiss Leangains as not being optimal.</p>
<p>In its simplest terms the Leangains Method is calorie and carb cycling, centered around high intensity/low volume resistance training, coupled with a daily 16/8 fast. From there, the rest is details depending on your goals, albeit in some cases very important details.</p>
<p>I will not discuss at this time all of the goals, but I will go into detail for the Fat Loss/Muscle Maintenance protocol, as I feel that is the one most people will fall into, and the one which gives the fastest results. I will not go into any of the technical or scientific explanations, because Martin has discussed these subjects in great detail on his blog. Also, I am in no way qualified to speak about the scientific background of why this happens, but rather I can speak to what happens and how to make them happen. I will link some of the most important blog posts at the end that explain a lot of this stuff.</p>
<h2>Fat Loss Protocol</h2>
<p><strong>The Fast:</strong></p>
<p>Daily 16/8 – Fast/Feeding window</p>
<p>Stop eating at a certain point, go 16 hours without consuming calories (sleep included) and then start eating the next day after the 16 hours is up. For example, I stop eating at 8pm and then eat my first meal at 12pm. In the morning during the fast you may consume no more than roughly 30kcal in a 3 hour time-frame. Most of the time, this will come from a splash of cream in coffee. You can drink anything that has no calories or less than 30kcal &#8211; water, diet drinks, tea, black coffee, zero or low calorie energy drinks (i.e. low carb monster – blue). This is not complicated, but there are ALWAYS a million questions about the fast. If it has no calories, it is fine. If it does have calories, be sure you do not consume more than 30kcal in a three hour period. You can move the feeding window to whatever time of day is more comfortable for you.</p>
<p><strong>Diet:</strong></p>
<p>The first thing is to find your Maintenance Caloric Intake. Lyle McDonald has a <a title="How to Find Maintenance Calories" href="http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/how-to-estimate-maintenance-caloric-intake.html" target="_blank">great article on finding maintenance</a> which basically states that for Males, multiply your current BW by 14-16.  Since our goal is weight loss, start with the low end of that recommendation as a starting point. So, multiply your bodyweight by 14. I’ll use an example of someone who is 185lbs. 185&#215;14= 2590 -&gt; round up to 2600kcal = M. Remember, this is all just estimates that will guide you. I round to the nearest hundred when calculating the templates. The name of the game is making adjustments based off of your results.</p>
<p>Next, you need to establish your over/under daily calorie target. I suggest starting out at M+10%/M-30%. So, 2600kcal (+) 10% and 2600kcal (-) 30%. The surplus calories will be assigned to your workout (WO) days, and the deficit will be assigned to your rest days… We will get to training in a minute. For now, just assume that we will be working out 3 days/week (M,W,F) The below table shows our example’s daily calorie targets for a week.</p>
<div id="attachment_3865" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 532px"><img class="wp-image-3865 pin-it" alt="weekly calorie target" src="http://leangainsguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/weekly-calorie-target.jpg" width="522" height="78" /><p class="wp-caption-text">***Unless you weigh 185lbs do not use this example.</p></div>
<p>After establishing calorie targets, we need to create some Macro Nutrient Ratios. I’ll go ahead and address a major issue now, because this is where most people take one extreme stance or the other – both of which are less than ideal, IMO.</p>
<p>If the tracking of these details is a spectrum, then on one extreme end you have someone who is anal retentive and tracks their daily eating down to the gram and calorie, and then on the other end there is the person who disregards everything and goes with 100% intuition. You want to be somewhere in the middle. You may need to start off being anal retentive, until you start to become more knowledgeable about nutrition and how to better estimate things, but you never want to completely leave it up to guess work either. I will say though, that the more understanding you have about nutrition, the more freedoms you will have – which will lead to feeling less restrictive, adding to the success rate of sustainability.</p>
<p>Back to Macros… when you boil it all down you want Protein to be almost constant at a moderate to high level – and then Fat/Carbs inversely cycled depending on the day. Again, this is all estimates – and honestly you have a lot more freedom with these ranges than one would think. For our example, the table below represents Macro Nutrient “TARGETS” for WO and Rest Days respectively.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3867 pin-it" alt="macronutrient targets" src="http://leangainsguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/macronutrient-targets.jpg" width="435" height="80" /></p>
<h2>How to Calculate Your Macronutrient Ratios</h2>
<p><strong>WO Day</strong></p>
<p>Protein (g) – 1 x BW – Round up to the nearest number that looks attractive -&gt; 200g</p>
<p>Carbs (g) – 2 x BW – round to nearest ten -&gt; 380g</p>
<p>Fill in the blanks with Fat – by following the instructions below. (1g Fat = 9kcal / 1g Carbs = 4kcal / 1g Protein = 4kcal)</p>
<p>(grams of protein x 4) + (grabs of carbs x 4) = P &amp; C kcal total</p>
<p>(Calorie Target in kcal) &#8211; (P &amp; C kcal total) = Fat kcal total</p>
<p>(Fat kcal total) / 9 = Fat in grams</p>
<p><strong>185 lbs Example</strong></p>
<p>(200g x 4) + (380g x 4) = 2320kcal</p>
<p>2900kcal – 2320kcal = 580kcal</p>
<p>580kcal / 9 = 65g</p>
<p><strong>Rest Day</strong></p>
<p>Protein (g) – 1 x BW – Round up to the nearest number that looks attractive -&gt; 200g</p>
<p>Carbs (g) – 60g -&gt; Everyone will use this number…seems arbitrary, but just go with it!</p>
<p>Fill in the blanks with Fat – by following instructions below. (1g Fat = 9kcal / 1g Carbs = 4kcal / 1g Protein = 4kcal)</p>
<p>(grams of protein x 4) + (grabs of carbs x 4) = P &amp; C kcal total</p>
<p>(Calorie Target in kcal) &#8211; (P &amp; C kcal total) = Fat kcal total</p>
<p>(Fat kcal total) / 9 = Fat in grams</p>
<p><strong>185 lbs Example</strong></p>
<p>(200g x 4) + (60g x 4) = 1040kcal</p>
<p>1800kcal – 1040kcalkcal = 760kcal</p>
<p>760kcal / 9 = 85g</p>
<p>On WO days think of Fat as your Macro Enemy, and don’t go above about 20% of total calories – in this case ~60g. If you want to eat more calories on this day from protein so that you are not eating 390g of carbs, go for it. If you want to stick with the above guidelines as close as possible, cool – the variance in results will be minimal. Just ensure you hit your protein minimum, while eating close (within 100kcal either way) of your kcal target and you will be fine.</p>
<p>On Rest Days, think of Carbs as your Macro Enemy. Do not exceed 60g on this day, and sources should be from fibrous veggies and incidentals from dairy (in moderation) including protein powders. Again, as long as Carbs are kept in check, you can increase protein, thus minimizing fat intake – just keep kcal intake at or slightly below your target.</p>
<p>Sometimes life gets in the way and you may find yourself in a situation where your numbers for the day are getting all screwed up. Below is the flow of elements in order of importance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3871 pin-it" alt="macronutrient order of importance" src="http://leangainsguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/macronutrient-order-of-importance.jpg" width="707" height="60" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next issue is the type of food choices.</p>
<p>I understand that some people feel very passionate about certain views (i.e Paleo) I have my own views on such topics, but I RESPECT each individual’s right to choose how they want to eat. On WO days, the majority of carbs should come from starches. If you are Paleo, I guess you will be eating a lot of sweet potatoes. If not, R.P.P.…rice, potatoes, pasta – and lots of it.</p>
<p>Fat on this day should mostly be incidental from meat and other protein sources.</p>
<p>On Rest Days, carb sources should be green fibrous vegetables and incidentals form protein sources. Avoid starches like the plague!<br />
Fattier cuts of meat should be eaten on this day, as well as various seed, nuts and oils while not exceeding the dietary fat target.</p>
<p>I have done so much experimenting with all variables in this equation, from eating STRICT Paleo, to getting my carbs in by eating Brown Sugar &amp; Cinnamon Pop Tarts + 8 bowls of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. From a body composition perspective, NO DIFFERENCE! Let me say though, THAT I DO NOT ADVISE ANYONE TO TAKE UP A DIET WITH SO MUCH REFINED SUGAR AND PROCESSED FOODS.</p>
<p>If you haven’t noticed, I take the middle of the ground on most issues. For me, a diet that is mostly made up of whole foods, but allows for an occasional treat (read every WO Day) while still being in the confines of the targets you established, is the best course of action over the long haul. The bottom line is that you can still eat within your set of beliefs while still adhering to the Leangains principles. Those of you who do not bear allegiance to said beliefs; you can splurge about with moderation with no negative effects on body composition.</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>I’ve experimented with this aspect of the equation a great deal over the years as well, and all roads lead back to Martin’s advice: High Intensity/Low Volume – 3 days a week – 1 day rest between sessions. Most people will feel more comfortable with a M, W, F scheme.</p>
<p>One important note is that your eating day revolves around your training day. If life gets in the way and you don’t train, eat as if it is a rest day. If you started eating carbs because it was a WO day and then it doesn’t happen…don’t freak out, just manage the piece you can control and eat low carb for the next meal. However, consistency is key, and ensuring all cylinders are firing away together is optimal</p>
<p><strong>–DO YOUR BEST NOT TO MISS YOUR TRAINING DAYS!</strong></p>
<p>Again, you have a great deal of latitude with the training, just ensure you are using mostly compound movements and as heavy as possible while overall volume is kept low ( i.e Reverse Pyramid Training (RPT) scheme, or 3&#215;5 or 3&#215;3). Be sure you are programming smartly and allowing for progressive overload (no matter how small the increases are).</p>
<p>Remember, you are hitting a weekly caloric deficit, so don’t expect to be smashing PRs every session, but if your strength is declining – then it is time for a smart and small dietary adjustment. Most people complain about wanting more freedom with training and diet, but when it comes down to it, they are scared shitless when someone gives them that freedom. They start to ask questions about very insignificant details because of fear of the unknown. This is natural and I’ve experienced it firsthand. The more knowledge you have about a subject, the more you can adjust things to mold it to your personal situation.</p>
<p>Below I have provided an 8 week “program” as a template. Either do it as is, or if you understand training principles – feel free to substitute movements or rep schemes as you see fit. Just remember to keep intensity high and volume low.</p>
<p>Follow an A/B split. Meaning alternate between two Workouts: A &amp; B – 4 week schedule is below.</p>

<p><strong>Reverse Pyramid Training (RPT):</strong></p>
<p>Do a proper warm up by incrementally loading the bar and performing the selected movement. After the warm up, you will do three total sets. Only track progress for the 1st working set (Top Set). The Top set will be done to failure or the rep before failure on Squats (you will know). The weight will be selected based on Failure being reached between the 3-5 rep range.</p>
<p>The first session may be tricky, but based on what rep you hit failure; you can make adjustments from there. Record the weight and reps of your Top Set only.</p>
<p>For the 2nd set, strip roughly 10% off and complete + 1 rep from before but not exceeding 5. If you got five on your top set, then do five on the 2nd. Things will work themselves out as you go along from session to session. Don’t sweat the small stuff.</p>
<p>The 3rd set will be roughly 10% less than the 2nd and for 5 reps.</p>
<p>Do not bring a calculator to the gym and don’t try to get exactly 10% off the bar by using fractional plates. If you hit 3 reps on your Top Set, then next time you do that movement keep the weight the same and try to get more reps when going to failure. If you reach 5 reps on the Top Set, increase the weight by an appropriate increment. Be conservative with increases…slow and steady progress is the name of the game, because our goal ultimately is fat loss, without muscle loss or strength loss. Trying to go up too much too fast might have negative effects.</p>

<p>Take a week off from heavy training, and repeat.</p>
<h2>Fasted Training</h2>
<p>You do not have to train fasted. Many say that it accelerates your progress, including me…but sometimes you don’t have a choice when you can train. If you have to go to the gym in the afternoon or evening, you will still get great results having eaten lunch earlier in the day. If you do train fasted the consumption of BCAA’s are advised. For more information on timing of your workout in relation to your eating schedule, go to the Leangains Guide link at the end of this article to get the info straight from the source.</p>
<p><strong>Track Progress</strong></p>
<p>There will be daily fluctuations in weight caused by water retention. Generally you will be heavier after workout days and lighter after rest days. Because of this, I would advise against just one reference day on the scale. I weigh myself every morning, just to get a feel for the trends. Slight ups and downs are fine, but a gradual average decrease over time is what we are after.</p>
<p>If every day weighing seems cumbersome, then I would suggest twice a week, Thursday and Sunday. This gives you an idea of a post-WO day weight and a post-rest day weight. Again, progress over time is what we are seeking.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes progress will not come in the form of pounds lost. For this reason, I suggest taking measurements at least every two weeks of at least Neck, Chest, Waist, Thighs. The mirror is also a good tool; as well as your training journal.</p>
<p>If you are slowly progressing on your lifts, while measurements stay the same or increase, weight on the scale is decreasing, and you look sexier in the mirror- then I would call that a success!</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>The higher your body fat percentage, the larger weekly deficit you can support. The lower you get, the more conservative you have to be with your deficit. There are no set guidelines for this, but I would say once you get to sub 9%, you should switch to the RECOMP protocol of M+20%/M-20%. This reduces your weekly deficit and ensures you are not losing muscle. Likewise, once you are content with BF%, you can switch to a Lean Gain protocol, M+20%/M… or, if you are totally content, straight maintenance. The over/under is a sliding scale that can be tweaked, and needs to be tweaked depending on progress and individual needs. The above mentioned ratios are just estimates from which to start.</p>
<p>The above information is from my interpretations from posts on Martin Berkhan’s Blog, www.leangains.com, as well as much trial and error to fill in the blanks that he intentionally left out. For those of you who have been around this long enough, we gave up all hopes of him finishing the book at least 3 years ago.</p>
<p>Below are some links to some posts that helped me along my way. Also, understand that the method has evolved some over the years, so over time the restrictions have gotten less and less with more experimentation. There is some material on the web that is old, and while those guidelines still work, in some cases the constraints were a bit tighter than necessary. I hope this helps…train and eat smart!</p>

<p>Last year was about getting lean and after achieving that, the plan was to get really ripped.. as in getting &#8220;six-pack abs ripped&#8221;.</p>
<p>I played around with a few diet methods late last year to test my body&#8217;s response before embarking on the more extreme methods that I had planned for Jan 1.  <a title="What is Ketosis" href="http://leangainsguide.com/diet/is-keto-the-best-fat-burning-diet/">Ketosis</a> was first on the list.  Since I have seen great results with low-carb and carb-cycling, I was certain that achieving keto, while cutting calories even further, would be all I needed to finally shred the last bit of fat.</p>
<p>I bought the keto strips and tested every day and night to ensure that <a title="Achieving Ketosis" href="http://leangainsguide.com/diet/what-full-ketosis-looks-like-my-keto-strip/">I reached the enlightened state of ketosis</a> [que heavenly ahhhhhs].</p>
<p>I decided to go with the cyclical keto diet and have a weekly re-feed day.. with a slightly longer window in the first week as keto can take a while to set in.</p>
<p>Aside from shooting for an all new low on carbohydrate intake, the other major change was a drastic reduction in calories.  Hey.. if 1500 calories a day was showing me slow results, 1000-1200 a day would have to work even better, right?</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t.</p>
<h2>My Keto Results</h2>
<p>After almost three weeks of keto and only two re-feed days, while on a drastic calorie cut, I am exactly the same weight as when I started.</p>
<p>If your initial thought is that I somehow under-calculated my calories, I can ensure that didn&#8217;t happen.  I weighed and measured everything I ate.  I more often ate at 1,000 calories but never went higher than 2,000 except on my re-feed days, where I ate 2,500 calories.</p>
<p>The only carbs I got were from broccoli, green beans and the occasional half-avocado.  Daily carbs never exceeded 40 grams and that kept me in ketosis.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to believe that I somehow lost <a title="Fat Loss Myths" href="http://leangainsguide.com/fitness/5-fat-loss-myths/">fat</a> and gained muscle but I simply can&#8217;t make that claim.  The mirror doesn&#8217;t show it and my strength is exactly where I started.</p>
<p>Operation Ketosis with a severe caloric deficit = FAIL.</p>
<p>No worries though..  every &#8220;fail&#8221; is one more piece of information I have on my way to success.</p>
<h2>Calories vs Hormones</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3849 pin-it" alt="burn fat" src="http://leangainsguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/burn-fat.jpg" width="320" height="256" />It seems pretty clear to me that losing the last bit of fat is more about controlling hormones and less about controlling calories.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read it many times before and I&#8217;ve never doubted it (just look at what steroids do to the typical body builder in manipulating hormones) but I also believed that I could circumvent the process and achieve similar results by focusing solely on a calorie deficit</p>
<p>No more..  I&#8217;m giving the proper attention to hormonal responses.</p>
<p>As world renowned Olympic trainer <a title="Charles Poliquin and Hormones" href="http://www.charlespoliquin.com/Blog/tabid/130/EntryId/574/The-Growth-Hormone-Response-Get-Anabolic-Pt2.aspx" target="_blank">Charles Poliquin</a> so emphatically teaches, every time we eat, we release hormones into the body.  The type of calories we eat determine which hormones get released.  Hormones have a huge effect on our insulin levels.. levels that are different in all of us.  The secret to a successful diet and leaning out is a successful diet coupled with your natural and diet affected hormonal states.</p>
<p>In short.. I&#8217;m going to eat a lot more.  As I don&#8217;t have access to the bio-metric screening methods employed by the industry leaders such as Poliquin, I can only be sure that I&#8217;m affecting hormones by eating a wider variety of food.. and more of it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll start focusing more on creating the caloric deficit through exercise.</p>
<p>I still have hopes for a nice six-pack by end of March but should I fail, the quest will continue.</p>
<p>As for Ketosis, I may revisit it after getting my calories back up around 2,000 and seeing a slow drop through the addition of exercise.  For now though, I&#8217;ll start with a low-calorie diet and hit a little carb-cycling.</p>
<p>Carb cycling was a proven winner for me last year when I was losing the bulk of my weight.</p>
<p>Ketosis is likely a winning strategy for fat loss so don&#8217;t let me discourage you.  Ketosis with a severe calorie deficit, however, is just a recipe to slow metabolism and get fat.</p>

<p>For the first time in almost two weeks I&#8217;ll be getting more than 40 carbs in one day.  There&#8217;s a large pizza at my favorite local pizza place with my name on it.  That and a dessert toward the end of the day will provide a few hundred carbs that are sure to knock me out of ketosis pretty quickly.</p>
<p>I had another sluggish evening last night.  I thought I was past that but clearly I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Just like the first energy crash I had, I decided to check my ketosis strip for a positive and was it ever!  I achieved the darkest color yet on my strip this time as shown in the picture below.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="wp-image-3818 aligncenter pin-it" alt="a positive keto result" src="http://leangainsguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ketostick.jpg" width="628" height="399" /></p>
<p>This color change was instant, as well.  As soon as the urine hit the stick, dark purple appeared.</p>
<p>Clearly, I&#8217;m burning fat.  <a title="Is Keto The Best Fat-Burning Diet?" href="http://leangainsguide.com/diet/is-keto-the-best-fat-burning-diet/">Ketosis</a> works.</p>
<h2>Extreme Dieting Confuses People</h2>
<p>If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned about extreme dieting, it&#8217;s that most people are confounded by it.</p>
<p>People are used to me eating healthy but even my healthy eating friends think I&#8217;ve crossed the line.  Still..  my 90 day goal is to get ripped and see my abs.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been devouring nothing but broccoli, almonds, <a title="Udo’s Oil – Weight Loss With Healthy Fats" href="http://leangainsguide.com/diet/udos-oil-weight-loss-with-healthy-fats/">Udo&#8217;s oil</a>, chicken breasts, natural peanut butter, avocado and eggs.  I&#8217;ve been weighing and measuring everything to the gram.</p>
<p>On seeing my results, I&#8217;m surprised by the typical questions I get from others.  Most want to know how I&#8217;m dieting and seem interested in replicating what I&#8217;m doing for similar results&#8230; at first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me exactly how you&#8217;re eating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many calories a day do you get?&#8221;</p>
<p>But on explaining my diet, I&#8217;m most often met with questions of how a similar result can be achieved without getting quite so extreme.  I can usually see the wheels turning as the blank stare sets in after I explain my nutrition process.  And then come the new questions&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can still eat a sweet here and there, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can have a cheat day at least once a week, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>When I start getting these questions, I instantly realize that the other person isn&#8217;t truly interested in getting lean.  He&#8217;s more interested in achieving a bit of weight loss while figuring out how to remain comfortable in his diet.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that as seeing your abs simply isn&#8217;t for everyone (it&#8217;s tough!), but if you truly want to get ripped, it&#8217;s time to stop thinking about being comfortable in your diet and start asking what more you can do to achieve the result?</p>
<p>Of all the things I&#8217;ve accomplished in my fitness experiences, nothing is proving to be as challenging as getting a ripped six-pack.  Self-doubt constantly creeps in and I just keep pushing it away.</p>
<p>The end of March is coming soon and I desperately want to show you guys that I&#8217;ve achieved what I set out to do.. something really special.  Week 2 is nearly over and 10 more weeks to go.</p>
<p>The next two weeks will see my diet change to mostly steak  and eggs, ala some old <a title="Vince Gironda Photos" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Gironda" target="_blank">Vince Gironda</a> principles.  Vince was one of the greatest physique trainers of all time and many of his nutrition views parallel those of being in ketosis, even though he was preaching this stuff before anyone knew the science behind it.</p>
<p>Mr. Olympias Arnold Schwarzenegger and Lou Ferrigno trained at Vince&#8217;s Gym.  He knew his stuff.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about seeing how lean you can get, I would suggest you read some of Gironda&#8217;s material.  It&#8217;s worthwhile.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m off to get my eight hours.  Have a great weekend.</p>

and I&#8217;ll back away from that statement as it&#8217;s not my intention to be in ketosis all the time, though it is possible that could happen with the amount of carbohydrates I&#8217;m getting.</p>
<p>The intention of this diet is simply to lose as much fat as possible, as quickly as possible, without sacrificing muscle.</p>
<p>That said, I did hit ketosis last week and I&#8217;ll refer to it some here, as it&#8217;s happening to me.</p>
<p>Having started this diet on Monday, I was getting exactly 43 carbs a day and it was Friday at 4pm when my body hit the wall.  I was working away and suddenly felt like every bit of energy was gone.  I nearly had to hold my head up to keep from falling asleep.</p>
<p>I left work a bit early and headed home.  I decided to grab a keto stick.  For the first time all week, the color had gone from neutral to a dark purple.  Clearly, I was in Ketosis.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with keto, you simply urinate on a small chemical keto stick (I got my box of 50 at Wal-Mart for about $6) and the results indicate if you have a spillover of ketones in your urine.  This is typical when going into ketosis.</p>
<p>In ketosis, the body stops burning carbs for energy and resorts to burning ketones, which is a waste product produced when the body is using fat as an energy source.</p>
<p>It feels good to know the body is burning fat.</p>
<p>What didn&#8217;t feel good was the sudden wave of diarrhea that hit me yesterday.  Thankfully, it was gone in little over an hour but for historical reference, it was akin to Montezuma&#8217;s Revenge that I experienced in Mexico some years back while it did last.</p>
<h2>High Fat Meals</h2>
<p>So far, so good.  I hit my macros every day and had the exact same meals all seven days of the week.  I&#8217;ll take my first cheat day this coming Friday.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m getting over 50% of my daily calories from fat and 36% is protein.  If you&#8217;ve never tried a high fat diet, I highly recommend it.  At a pretty low caloric intake, I am not getting hungry at all.  It&#8217;s a bit surprising actually.</p>
<p>Intermittent Fasting is helping to suppress the appetite as well, as I don&#8217;t eat any food until 1pm.</p>
<p>I was not even tempted by the huge bowl of Hershey&#8217;s kisses that my wife bought and had on the counter all week.</p>
<p>The diet itself is a hybrid diet of Mauro Di Pasquale&#8217;s &#8220;<a title="The Anabolic Diet" href="http://www.amazon.com/Anabolic-Solution-Bodybuilders-Mauro-Pasquale/dp/0967989612/?tag=go2getinfo-20" target="_blank">The Anabolic Diet</a>&#8220;.  Through several different trial and error experiments last year (most recorded here on this website), I found that a reduction is carbs was the most significant factor in reducing fat for me.  I also found out that I do well on a high fat diet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m formulating a diet in accordance to what works best for my body.  Some people can achieve great results with high carbs.  I can&#8217;t.</p>
<h2>Results Thus Far</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to accurately measure how much weight/fat I lost in this first week.  As I stated in my original post, I went on a binge the last week of December and that saw me shoot up from 158 lbs 5 days prior, to 165 lbs before starting this diet.</p>
<p>I dare say I gained a bit of fat in that week too.  I just looked a bit plumper.</p>
<p>I was obviously going to drop some weight pretty quickly when I returned home and started ridding my body of carbs.</p>
<p>However.. I am down even lower than expected.  My week 1 results had me weighing in at 158.8 lbs.  The fat calipers showed the same results as any normal day in December and the mirror attests to that.</p>
<p>No hurry though. I have 11 more weeks and expect to see the most dramatic changes ever in that time frame.</p>
<p>I plan to lose at least a pound a week and keep the focus on making sure that is purely fat loss.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t signed up, please subscribe below.  I&#8217;ll be posting all my pictures, results and full diet, at the end of March.  I&#8217;m looking forward to Spring already!</p>

<p>To get lean and ripped, one must start working a few months in advance and Jan 1 allows for the perfect opportunity.</p>
<p>For me, 2012 was a great success.  I lost over 12% body fat, but admittedly, I slacked during the end of the year.  I slacked because I knew summer was coming to an end and I didn&#8217;t really love the idea of being at my leanest just as the cold weather was coming into season.</p>
<p>However, I used the opportunity to try some different dieting methods and I learned a few new things about my body so I found success while maintaining weight.  No regrets.</p>
<p>I managed to eat better than any other year of my life in 2012.  The only landslide failure I had was the last week of December.. as in last week.  I was at the in-laws for three days and had two more Christmas parties on my return.  There was more sugary goodness than a person should ever have access to.</p>
<p>The day after all of that, I ate my worst.  I simply said.. &#8220;Ah the hell with it.  What&#8217;s one more day?&#8221;.  I hit Incredible Pizza and didn&#8217;t even consider walking away until I was over-stuffed.</p>
<p>I indulged.. and a lot.  Admittedly, it was a planned indulgence and that might not technically allow me to call it a &#8220;landslide failure&#8221; but I ended up eating far more than I had planned.</p>
<p>So why the lack of year-long devotion?  Why did I go crazy in the last week of the nutritionally healthiest year of my life?</p>
<p>I knew that January 1st was right around the corner and since the end of summer, I&#8217;ve quietly preparing for this day.</p>
<h2>90 Days of Ketosis</h2>
<p>For the next three months, I expect my body to transform into the leanest state I have ever known.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be eating at a severe caloric deficit and most importantly, I&#8217;ll be relying on fats for energy, since I&#8217;ll be getting virtually no carbs.</p>
<p>The majority of my carbohydrates will come from broccoli and green beans (if not all).  Any all all green veggies are allowed.</p>
<p>The majority of my diet will be from healthy fats and proteins will come in second.</p>
<p>Ketosis, or <a title="What is Ketosis" href="http://leangainsguide.com/diet/is-keto-the-best-fat-burning-diet/">Keto</a>, is one of the quickest ways to build a lean body.  Keto is also one of the more confusing topics for a lot of body builders and lean body practitioners.  There&#8217;s an Adkins vibe associated with ketosis and unfortunately, that keeps many from exploring the many benefits of burning ketones for fuel.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid of short-term no/low carb diets for leaning up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll also be fasting 16 hours every day and eating all my food in an 8 hour window, engaging in the most popular form of intermittent fasting.</p>
<p>The strengths of keto and intermittent fasting are likely to give me substantial results.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in how this turns out, I encourage you to subscribe below.  I can guarantee impressive results.  I don&#8217;t cheat on my diets when I&#8217;m highly motivated and I&#8217;ve been waiting for this since about the time fall came around last year.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t promise that I won&#8217;t drop some muscle, but there will be a drastic reduction in body fat.  I do plan on taking several steps to preserve muscle so hopefully, any muscle lost will be minimal.</p>
<p>My wife, Amy, just took some images of me so that I&#8217;ll be able to compare the final results with 1/1/2013.  I&#8217;ll fully explain the diet and exercise components of this plan on completion.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Your New Year&#8217;s Resolution?</h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3791 pin-it" alt="new years resolutions" src="http://leangainsguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/new-years-resolutions.jpg" width="448" height="255" />I really hope you take the opportunity of a new year to make at least one new healthy resolution.</p>
<p>If you decide to give it a go at being extreme as I&#8217;m doing here, be careful and let me know what you&#8217;re up to.  I&#8217;d love to follow a few others with some lofty goals.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to just start simple and make small changes.  It&#8217;s all about building up to a better &#8220;you&#8221; and creating positive change.</p>
<p>Maybe you just need to start eating healthier?</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;re a smoker needing to quit?</p>
<p>Maybe you have a lot of weight to lose?</p>
<p>While the new year can be looked on as &#8220;just another day&#8221;, it really is a great time to make change.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s to 2013 being our best year yet!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s to 2012 and all that you achieved en route to your lean body.</p>
<p>Hopefully, 2012 was a year that saw positive change in many areas of your life.  All positive growth is an open door to even greater opportunity.</p>
<p>In the diet world, 2012 saw a fair share of positive health trends, many of which we hope to see continue.  Meal frequency is slowly being recognized as not necessary.  Macro-nutrient ratios are still considered important and calories in/calories out still gets the nod for the most important factor in fat loss.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a look at the top diet trends of 2012.</p>
<h2>Fat is Your Friend</h2>
<p>Thankfully, dietary fat is finally getting the positive recognition it is so deserved.  Healthy new fats are needed to rid the body of stubborn body fat and by focusing your eating on unsaturated fats, such as found in nuts, avocados, olive oil and fish, one can accelerate fat burning in the body while supplying healthy brain food that aids with mental focus and clarity.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on a diet and limiting calories and/or carbohydrates in an attempt to get lean, the added benefit of mental clarity is a must.</p>
<p>While the jury is still out on carbohydrates (some diets swear by them and some vilify them), fats have become regarded as highly important, across the board.  Many <a title="Is Keto The Best Fat-Burning Diet?" href="http://leangainsguide.com/diet/is-keto-the-best-fat-burning-diet/">keto</a> diets are built on high fat solutions and the results are impressive.</p>
<h2>Intermittent Fasting is Hip</h2>
<p>IF (Intermittent Fasting), has been around a few years and 2012 has only increased the popularity.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to eat in an eight-hour window everyday or do the occasional 24-hour fast, there are <a title="Fasting Benefits" href="http://leangainsguide.com/diet/igf-1-and-fasting/">benefits to be gained by fasting</a>.</p>
<p>While IF isn&#8217;t a magic bullet for results, many regard it as a nice alternative to eating every few hours.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Nutrients Has Emerged</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s always been considered important to &#8220;eat your greens&#8221; but 2012 has really expounded on the many benefits of getting your calories from a range of different foods.  Nutrients have a highly positive effect on your diet goals.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just about greens either. There&#8217;s a full spectrum of vitamins and nutrients that your body needs while dieting.  Depriving your body of nutrients while in a caloric deficit is a roadblock to results, so eat a lot of different foods and take those vitamins.</p>
<h2>Say &#8216;No&#8217; to Sugar</h2>
<p>The detriments of sugar and substitutes, such as <a title="How to Quit High Fructose Corn Syrup" href="http://leangainsguide.com/diet/how-quit-high-fructose-corn-syrup/">high-fructose corn syrup</a>, continue to be highlighted and when it comes to losing fat, sugar is public enemy number one.  Nothing else can hinder results like ingesting large amounts of sugar, as is still so common in the average American diet.</p>
<p>Sugar is also the culprit for heart disease, as Dr. Sinatra talks about in his book, &#8216;<a title="Sugar and Heart Disease" href="http://leangainsguide.com/diet/cholesterol-heart-disease-not-linked/">The Great Cholesterol Myth</a>&#8216;.  Sugar also causes problems such as cancer, diabetes, depression and many other health related issues.</p>
<p>Remove sugar from your diet and you&#8217;ll welcome a new life that carries many health benefits.</p>
<h1>What&#8217;s New in 2013?</h1>
<p>While 2013 will no doubt present some new diet trends and give us new information, the formula for being healthy will remain the same.  Eat in moderation and choose healthy foods.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you learned some things about your body in 2012 and can use that to even further your results in this new year.</p>
<p>Rather you started last year or 2013 is your &#8220;year of change&#8221;, make a pact for a healthier you and make 2013 the year that you finally achieved that lean, hard body you always desired.</p>
<p>Happy New Year to everyone.  Love your family and friends.  We&#8217;re all here for a just a short while&#8230; let&#8217;s enjoy the journey together.</p>

<p>Over the last 33 days, I ate 3,000 calories every first and second day and then I abstained from all food (or calories of any kind) every third day.  This averages out to 2,000 calories a day.</p>
<p>On my eating days, I halted all my caloric intake every night at 9pm.  Since day 1 always followed a full day of fasting, I began eating at 8-9am, depending on when I woke.</p>
<p>On day 2, I always waited until 1pm to eat, creating a more common window of fasting for 16 hours.  Again, I stopped eating at 9pm, skipped the entire next day of eating and waited until waking up the next day to eat.  This made for a 35-36 hour fast every third day.</p>
<p>I only trained on eating days and I did no cardio during this experiment.</p>
<h2>3rd Day Fasting Results</h2>
<p>Willpower was not as as big a factor as I had feared.  I really didn&#8217;t struggle to do this at all.  Perhaps having a few 36 hour fasts earlier in the year helped.  I knew what to expect and surprisingly, I was never terribly hungry.  Doing a <a title="Get Ripped With An EC Stack" href="http://leangainsguide.com/diet/get-ripped-with-an-ec-stack/">EC Stack</a> on my fasting days seemed to help a lot as well.</p>
<p>My wife thought I was a bit crazy and she was a firm reminder to me that long periods of fasting are not for everyone.  It&#8217;s a psychological game in many aspects but after the first week, I was able to mentally chalk it up to a new habit and it stuck pretty easy.</p>
<p>While fasting, it&#8217;s important to treat hunger as a fat-burning signal and not a signal that it&#8217;s time to eat.. which is unfortunately how we normally train our bodies.</p>
<p>Would I have preferred to eat?  Yes.  Though I certainly never felt like I was starving, the idea of a simple, small meal in the middle of my long days seemed very appealing.  Science was at stake though, so I stuck to the plan.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;re wondering about is the effect on body composition, right?</p>
<p>Well I would love to say that I lost a lot of fat and gained muscle, but I can&#8217;t honestly say that my body composition changed in any way.  In fact, I took a before and after photo and had planned on posting them, but try as I might, I don&#8217;t see a bit of difference in the two photos.</p>
<p>Additionally, my calipers showed the exact same measurement of body fat.</p>
<p>As for the scale, I weighed 158 this morning and that&#8217;s almost exactly where I started.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still a couple of interesting things to note, however.</p>
<p>First, I went from consuming around 1600 calories a day to averaging 2,000 calories a day.  I also raised my carbohydrate days to 300.  Previously, I was at 150 or less.</p>
<p>I would have thought the increase in calories would have contributed to a difference in weight at the end of 30 days, but it did not.</p>
<p>Is it possible that I&#8217;ve helped to repair a bit of metabolic damage and I&#8217;ve created a new set point for daily calories?  I plan to maintain 2,000 calories a day and 300 carbs for the next month, so I&#8217;ll know more soon.</p>
<p>The most surprising result of my experiment was an increase in strength.  I typically bench 90-pound dumbbells for 6 reps at my max.  I was able to do eight on the last two consecutive chest workouts.  This was the first time all year I&#8217;ve been able to accomplish this.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3756 aligncenter pin-it" alt="Fasting-and-Strength" src="http://leangainsguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Fasting-andStrength.jpg" width="615" height="242" /></p>
<p>My dips went from 36 to 42.  My squat increased, as well.  I was able to add 40 more pounds for six reps.</p>
<p>Increased energy was the other surprising outcome.  I felt far more energetic every day.  This may have been due to an increase in carbohydrates though, but I was shocked at how much better I felt overall.</p>
<p>There you have it!  Another 30+ day experiment completed and those were my results.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m picking today to end the trial because I&#8217;m headed to Arkansas to spend some family time with the in-laws and they like to eat out.  I&#8217;ve been strict as possible during this entire holiday season (and year for that matter) so I&#8217;m going to enjoy a few days of eating and indulging before hitting it hard on my  return.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope everyone has a great rest of the year and gets to spend a little time with loved ones.  Working out is a passion but there&#8217;s no substitute for surrounding yourself with people you love and just enjoying life.</p>
<p>Have a great Christmas, Hanukkah or whatever holiday you celebrate.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s plenty of examples of people doing it right there on the commercial so it must be true, right?</p>
<p>The &#8220;infomercial mindset&#8221; is creating a lot of problems in the fitness world. It&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s not possible.. for some. It&#8217;s that it&#8217;s highly unlikely.. for most.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an important distinction to make as you head down the road to getting that lean and ripped body that you&#8217;ve always wanted. Only giving yourself 90 days to be in top shape creates a couple major hurdles.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft pin-it" title="arrow" src="http://leangainsguide.com/images/arrow.gif" alt="" width="25" height="20" />A 90 mindset is setting yourself up for failure.  I personally witnessed a friend two months in on P90X lose faith and stop working out.  Why?  It was the realization that the end result was not within reach in another 30 days.</p>
<p>The 60 day change that he hoped for simply wasn&#8217;t happening so why bother with the next 30?  P90X obviously wasn&#8217;t working right?  It&#8217;s human nature to quit instead of going the distance and failing.</p>
<p>Quitting feels like control maintained.  Unfortunately, the truth of the matter is that quitting achieves nothing while failing demonstrates a continual desire to succeed that allows for more growth and ultimate success.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">People do not fail.  People quit.</span></p>
<p>When you shorten the window of opportunity for a person who hasn&#8217;t learned how to be successful, there&#8217;s a greater chance for failure.</p>
<p>90 days is a great window for seeing some very positive changes and even some substantial changes but for the average overweight person, it&#8217;s not near enough time for a total transformation.</p>
<p><img title="arrow" src="http://leangainsguide.com/images/arrow.gif" alt="" width="25" height="20" class=" pin-it" />A 90 day mindset is simply the wrong way to approach fitness and nutrition.  If you&#8217;re ready to get your body in top shape and get ripped, why on earth is a 90 day window of any importance?</p>
<p>It creates a mentality of &#8220;being finished&#8221; in 90 days.  Then what?  Mission accomplished.. time to ease up on the diet and exercise and enjoy a little more pizza and maybe a few more carbs?  We all know where that leads.</p>
<blockquote><p>But 90 days worked great for me!&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I also know my share of people that have excelled at 90 day fitness programs.  They can be very effective and even more so  for those experienced with fitness and working out.</p>
<p>This post isn&#8217;t so much about blasting the 90 day fitness programs.  It&#8217;s about all the benefits gained from giving yourself a full year to get in top shape.</p>
<p>The inspiration of this post today came by way of a friend who told me this week at work that she did the entire &#8220;<a title="Insanity Workout" href="http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/insanity.do" target="_blank">Insanity</a>&#8221; workout (only 60 days in this program!) and the scale never moved.  She weighed exactly the same when she started as when she finished and felt like she had lost very little fat.</p>
<p>She was discouraged.  I could hear it in her voice and see it her eyes.</p>
<p>These are the people I worry about when it comes to healthy change and achieving the fitness dreams we all have.  These are the fallout victims of infomercials that we never read about.</p>
<p>These people rarely even post their experiences on blogs because they tend to carry the burden of failure themselves instead of blaming a program that is seemingly working for everyone else.  They feel responsible when the reality is that they simply haven&#8217;t learned enough about how their own bodies</p>
<p>I&#8217;m talking about the &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">hard losers</span>&#8220;, the &#8220;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">heavier than most</span>&#8220;, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">people who don&#8217;t consider themselves athletic or physically strong</span> and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inexperienced people</span> who are finally ready to create change but have no idea where to start.</p>
<p>This group represents a very large segment of those new to fitness and it&#8217;s critical that discouragement doesn&#8217;t quickly set in, which is a tendency that members of this group will naturally have.</p>
<h2>The Importance of 1 Year Fat Loss Goals</h2>
<p>Rather the goal is losing fat, getting fit or getting downright ripped, making the decision to change is the first step and it&#8217;s usually done with a degree of excitement and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The journey that follows is the challenge and learning about your body is what will ultimately lead to success or a lack of progress.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3742 aligncenter pin-it" title="year-results" src="http://leangainsguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/year-results.jpg" alt="year-results" width="548" height="178" /></p>
<p>How well do you know your body?  Here&#8217;s some questions that will likely need answering:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many carbohydrates allows you to maintain energy while achieving effective weight loss?</li>
<li>How quickly does your body drop fat?</li>
<li>How many daily calories do you need (your <a title="What's my BMR?" href="http://leangainsguide.com/bmr-calculator/">BMR</a> and TDEE)?</li>
<li>How do you respond to a plateau?</li>
<li>How do you measure body fat?</li>
<li>What are the proper macro-nutrient ratios for you?</li>
<li>How much cardio (if any) should you integrate to accomplish your goals?</li>
</ul>
<p>The list goes on and on.  The only way to know the answers to such questions is to take it slow and learn your body.</p>
<p>Accept failure as part of the process and try new things to learn how your body responds to different methods and stimuli.  Try changing up your calorie intake or your carb intake for a couple weeks.  No change?  No problem.  There&#8217;s one more piece of information you have about how your body responds to a particular condition.</p>
<p>A year allows a person to keep frustration at bay.  It expects the occasional plateau and thinks little of it when it comes along.</p>
<p>By allowing a full year for change, a person accumulates a great amount of data and understands the body in a deep and personal way.  This kind of change is consistent with long and lasting healthy habits.</p>
<p>Engaging in a two or three month program is about drastic and immediate change but for many, it&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t allow for the knowledge needed to maintain their physique.  For some, it doesn&#8217;t even explain the change that just occurred.</p>
<p>Slow change is not only important for knowledge.  It&#8217;s the best way to create permanent physical change.</p>
<h2>1 Year Later</h2>
<blockquote><p><em>Time will explain it all. He is a talker, and needs no questioning before he speaks.</em> – Euripides</p></blockquote>
<p>At the end of a full year of getting in shape and getting to know your body, you&#8217;re going to be happy with the results.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re really trying to lean out and drop down to those nearly impossible body fat numbers, you may still have a bit to go but you will now know that you can do it.  You&#8217;ll have enough information to fully understand your body and you&#8217;ll know <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>how</em></span> to make the change.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s priceless information.</p>
<p>For the majority, a year is enough to achieve every goal.. and that includes change for many very obese body types.</p>
<p>In the end, the knowledge gained equates to learned fitness habits that will serve you well the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Expect perfection.. just don&#8217;t rush it.  One year isn&#8217;t just about changing your body.  It&#8217;s about changing your life.</p>

<p>Hitting a weight loss plateau while on a diet can be a direct result of low leptin.  Let&#8217;s discuss what Leptin is and how to fix low leptin levels for accelerated fat burning.</p>
<h2>What is Leptin?</h2>
<p>Discovered as recently as 1994, Leptin is a protein hormone that is produced by specific fat cells known as adipocytes (cells specialized for the storage of fat and found in connective tissue).</p>
<p>Maintaining proper Leptin levels is one of the most critical factors in maintaining good health and keeping body fat off.</p>
<p>Haven&#8217;t heard much about it?  Being new to the scene, Leptin has yet to receive the attention it deserves.  Nora T. Gedgaudas, CNS CNT states the following in her book, &#8220;Primal Body, Primal Mind&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you haven&#8217;t heard of leptin, even if your doctor hasn&#8217;t heard of it, don&#8217;t be surprised.  Drug companies have yet to create any drug that can positively influence leptin function.   <em>Diet is the only thing that can effectively do this. *</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It would be easy to dismiss Leptin as not being that important, since it receives such little attention, but investigation into the protein hormone reveals just how critical it is.</p>
<p>Mary J. Shomon, author of  &#8221;The Thyroid Diet&#8221; puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Leptin plays a far more important role in your health than, for instance, cholesterol, yet how many doctors measure leptin levels in their patients, know their own level, even know that it can be easily measured, or even what it would mean? **</p></blockquote>
<p>Online author and neurosurgeon, Dr. Jack Kruse says of Leptin:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ok so you have heard me talk a lot about leptin. Why is it so important? It is a hormone that controls all of energy metabolism in the body. Not only that it controls all the other hormones in the body as well. So if it is not working well you can bet that the rest of your hormones are going to show clinical problems as well. I can’t tell you how many people think they have thyroid issues when all the time they have been leptin resistant. ***</p></blockquote>
<p>By now, you should be seeing just how important Leptin is.  Let&#8217;s take a quick look at how it works.</p>
<h2>How Leptin Works</h2>
<p>Everyone has a particular threshold of Leptin that is maintained in the body and falling under this threshold is what causes the production of more Leptin.</p>
<p>Fat secretes Leptin (in addition to many hormones).  When you&#8217;ve had enough to eat, the Leptin protein travels primarily to, and communicates with, the hypothalamus in the brain (there are other Leptin receptors in the body as well, including on our taste buds), alerting it that your level is up to normal again and that stored energy is now sufficient.  This signals satiety and when working as designed, you now feel full and are encouraged to put the spoon down.</p>
<p>Low Leptin levels causes intense food cravings and keep us continually hungry.  It also encourages fat storage.  By not receiving the &#8220;I&#8217;m full&#8221; signal, our bodies believe we need more energy and conditions become more favorable for converting calories to fat.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-3633 aligncenter pin-it" title="Leptin Resistance" src="http://leangainsguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/LeptinResistance.jpg" alt="Leptin Resistance" width="468" height="350" /></p>
<p>When working correctly, Leptin actually encourages the body to draw energy from longer-term fat stores, reducing them in size.</p>
<p>Amazingly, Leptin levels actually increase while you sleep so getting a good night&#8217;s sleep should result in a reduced appetite, thanks to Leptin.</p>
<p>Simply put, Leptin regulates hunger and metabolism by regulating energy intake and expenditure.</p>
<h2>Leptin Problems</h2>
<p>The more fat you have, the more leptin is produced in an attempt to tell the brain that there&#8217;s enough fat stored and to start using it for energy.  That sounds ideal and it would be except that all obese people have too much Leptin and this condition is known as Leptin Resistance (LR).</p>
<p>With LR, Leptin levels are too high but your brain never gets the message so you&#8217;re continually hungry.  You keep eating and LR worsens.  Having an over-abundance of Leptin and being Leptin resistant means your body just keeps producing more and more Leptin because signalling is broken, so it has no way of knowing when to stop.</p>
<p>Leptin signalling works in conjunction with neuropeptide Y (NPY), which are peptide neurotransmitters secreted by the hypothalamus in response to Leptin proteins.  It&#8217;s actually neuropeptide Y that is not getting shut off and causes hunger to continue, ultimately resulting in the metabolism slowing down.</p>
<p>LR goes hand in hand with <a title="Glycogen Loading and Insulin Resistance" href="http://leangainsguide.com/diet/glycogen-loading/">insulin resistance</a>.  In fact, Leptin Resistance always shows up before insulin resistance, so getting a handle on LR means you&#8217;re effectively fixing insulin resistance problems too.  Great news!</p>
<h2>Leptin Research</h2>
<p>Just how unknown is Leptin?  I decided to take a trip to my local Barnes &amp; Noble to see how many top diet and nutrition books addressed this all important protein.  In the last century, the majority of these books never once mention Leptin.  This list includes the following popular books:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enter The Zone (Barry Sears, Ph.D)</li>
<li>Sugar Busters (H. Leighton Steward, Morrison Bethea M.D., Sam Andrews M.D., Luis Balart M.D.)</li>
<li>Why We Get Fat (Gary Taubes)</li>
<li>The Rotation Diet (Martin Katahn, Ph.D)</li>
<li>The Blood Sugar Solution (Mark Hyman, MD)</li>
<li>The South Beach Diet - (Arthur Agatston)</li>
<li>Eat to Live (Joel Fuhrman, M.D.)</li>
<li>The Paleo Diet (Loren Cordain, Ph.D)</li>
<li>The Paleo Solution (Loren Cordain, Ph.D)</li>
<li>Crack the Fat Loss Code (Wendy Chant, MPT SPN)</li>
</ul>
<div>There were many more that didn&#8217;t mention Leptin and it was rare that I found a book that did.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Of those that did delve into the topic, I found a nice section in Jillian Michael&#8217;s (The Biggest Loser) book &#8220;Master Your Metabolism&#8221; and my two favorite books that went into great detail were the following:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>The Thyroid Diet (Mary J. Shomon)</li>
<li>Primal Body, Primal Mind (Nora T Gedgaudas, CNS, CNT)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Leptin For Losing Weight</h2>
<p>There are more and more Leptin studies being conducted.  When Leptin was originally discovered, it was hailed as the next obesity savior.  The original Ob Mouse (as it was known) was an obese mouse with no explanation as to why it was obese.  Scientists were stumped.</p>
<p>Studies soon revealed that this mouse was missing the hormone, Leptin.  Injections of Leptin caused the obese mouse to lose all it&#8217;s fat and gain a clearly defined six-pack (alright, I made that part up).</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies saw huge dollar signs as the news spread of a new obesity cure. Unfortunately, as more studies were conducted, it was soon realized that all obese people had excess Leptin.</p>
<p>Leptin was indeed, the root of the problem.  But it wasn&#8217;t a lack of the Leptin hormone or low levels.  It was Leptin Resistance, caused by years of over-eating.</p>
<p>Science and pharmaceutical companies dismissed Leptin as being important any longer, since it could not be controlled by drugs.</p>
<p>Although science can&#8217;t sell you a drug to help with Leptin, ongoing studies are showing very positive results in controlling, and even curing Leptin Resistance through sustained diet and positive lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>What are the best ways to reset Leptin levels and rid your body of Leptin Resistance if you&#8217;re trying to lose weight?</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don&#8217;t lose weight too fast.</span>  -  Rapid weight loss makes for a dramatic decrease in Leptin levels, which slows the metabolism and the burning of fat.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stay away from high fructose corn syrup.</span>  -  <a title="LR and HFCS" href="http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/295/5/R1370.abstract" target="_blank">Studies</a> have shown that it increases LR.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Get plenty of sleep.</span>  Depleted Leptin levels are restored with sleep.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Keep sugar intake at a minimum.</span>  There&#8217;s just not many good effects that sugar has on the body and LR is yet another negative effect of too much sugar.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Eat a really big meal once in a while.</span>  If you&#8217;re someone who makes a habit of never eating more than 300-400 calories p/ meal and or keeping daily calories low, having the occasional big meal will restore Leptin levels to the norm and increase metabolism.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to future studies on the Leptin hormone.  I believe that this all-important hormone will receive far more attention in the diet world as the critical role it plays becomes common knowledge.</p>
<p>Is it possible that in learning to effectively control Leptin, we may truly find the key to eliminating obesity?<br />

<p>Did you know reducing IGF-1 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1) by fasting is one of the best ways to reduce weight and stave off life threatening diseases such as cancer and diabetes?</p>
<p>Fasting seems to finally be getting some of the much deserved attention it&#8217;s been owed.  There&#8217;s still a long way to go but a program recently aired by the BBC entitled &#8216;Horizon: Eat, Fast and Live Longer&#8217;, is creating a lot of new talk about fasting on health forums everywhere.</p>
<p>In the airing, Michael Mosley sets out with a goal of trying to slow the aging process.  He looks at success stories and visits a fair share of institutions that deal specifically with the effects of the body on calorie restriction&#8230; aka: &#8220;fasting&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mosley learns that fasting has benefits that might only otherwise be found by bathing in the legendary Fountain of Youth.</p>
<p>This is a long video (just under 1 hour), so sit back and relax and if you&#8217;re new to fasting (beyond merely understanding the concept of what it is), be prepared to be surprised.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll then discuss the Mosley&#8217;s findings and the added benefits of fasting when combined with weight lifting, which is a topic not covered in the video.</p>
<h1>Eat, Fast and Live Longer Video</h1>

<h2>Key Points Made in Video</h2>
<p>From 1929 to 1933, in the darkest years of the great depression when people were eating far less, life expectancy increased by 6 years.</p>
<p>IGF-1 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1) growth hormone links calorie restriction and longevity and inhibits apoptosis of cells.</p>
<p>when IGF-1 levels drop, the body slows production of new cells and instead, repairs existing cells. DNA damage gets fixed and age-related diseases don&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>The IGF-1 hormone is one of the drivers which keep our bodies in &#8220;go-go mode&#8221;, with cells driven to reproduce. This is fine when you are growing, but not so good later in life.</p>
<p>Mosley explains: &#8220;IGF-1 and other growth factors keep our cells constantly active. It’s like driving with your foot on the accelerator pedal, which is fine when your body is shiny and new, but keep doing this all the time and it will break down.&#8221;</p>
<p>People with Laron Syndrome have exceptionally low levels of IGF-1 and as a result, do not get diabetes or cancer. They smoke and eat whatever they want and are overweight.</p>
<p>Protein affects the amount of IGF-1 produced. Your cells grow too fast to be efficiently repaired.</p>
<p>How do you reduce IGF-1?</p>
<p>You cut calories and protein intake or.. engage in fasting. Fasting decreases glucose level and the production of IGF-1.</p>
<p>Moseley learns that hunger does not build and build.. but comes in waves and passes.</p>
<p>Sporadic bouts of hunger actually trigger new neruons to grow and create new born brain cells. Fasting stresses your brain matter in the way that fasting stresses your muscles.</p>
<p>Mosely tried the 5:2 diet and after 5 weeks of the 5:2 diet, IGF-1 was reduced by 50%. Blood sugar (glucose) became normal and good cholesterol was increased. The risk of developing life threatening diseases was greatly reduced, including the top 2; cancer and diabetes.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a great study that supports the findings of Michael Mosely and the benefits of <a title="Benefits of Alternate Day Fasting" href="A study supporting ADF:  http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/81/1/69.full" target="_blank">alternate day fasting</a>.</p>
<h2>Fasting and Weight Lifting</h2>
<p>Mosely didn&#8217;t cover the aspect of weight lifting while fasting.  Fasting is a proven method of burning fat but it&#8217;s also a superb way of getting in the best shape of your life by engaging in short fasts that maintain muscle.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to fast, be sure to add some resistance training in the mix on the days when you do consume calories.</p>
<p>One of the fears of fasting is people often believe they&#8217;ll lose muscle by not eating frequently.  Meal frequency is a proven myth and books such as &#8216;<a title="Eat Stop Eat Expanded" href="http://783fffqxq58bt8z6mnxj3fg337.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=EATSTOPEAT" target="_blank">Eat Stop Eat Expanded</a>&#8216; really delve into this.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t read this one, it&#8217;s one of the best around.  Even if you read the original book (before the expanded version), this one has a plethora of great new information regarding fat loss.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s double the length, with new chapters on hunger, resistance training and weight training! The leading on-line book on flexible intermittent fasting just got even better. People love this book for a reason.</p>
<p><a href="http://783fffqxq58bt8z6mnxj3fg337.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=EATSTOPEAT" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter pin-it" title="Eat Stop Eat Expanded" src="http://leangainsguide.com/images/EatStopEatExpanded.jpg" alt="Eat Stop Eat Expanded" width="200" height="197" /></a></p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t it interesting that fasting is still so commonly dismissed by health experts?  Is this simply in fear of passing on a method that might more commonly trigger eating disorders?  The potential for that to happen is certainly there but at some point, the truth about fasting is going to be common knowledge and it&#8217;s likely to add years to our lives.</p>
<p>Hope everyone has a super Thanksgiving Day!</p>
